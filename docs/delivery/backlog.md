## Active Backlog

| ID | Actor | User Story | Status | Conditions of Satisfaction (CoS) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| PBI-001 | Frontend Developer | As a frontend developer, I need a complete backend API that handles user authentication, graph management, CrewAI execution, and real-time streaming so that users can create, configure, and execute CrewAI crews through a visual interface. | Agreed | [PBI-001 Detail](mdc:PBI-001/prd.md) |
| PBI-002 | User | As a user, I need a modern React frontend application that allows me to register with a pseudo and login with a generated passphrase, create and manage CrewAI crews through a visual graph interface, so that I can build and execute AI workflows without password complexity. | Agreed | [PBI-002 Detail](mdc:PBI-002/prd.md) |
| PBI-003 | User | As a user, I need a chat interface that allows me to communicate with my CrewAI graphs through natural language messages, so that I can interact with my crews conversationally and receive streamed responses in real-time. | Agreed | [PBI-003 Detail](mdc:PBI-003/prd.md) |
