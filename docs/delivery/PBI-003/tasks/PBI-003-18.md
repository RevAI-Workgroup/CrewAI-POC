| 2024-12-28 | complete_implementation | Agreed | Done | Chat routes configured with nested structure | AI_Agent |

## Requirements
- Add chat route constants to routes.ts
- Configure nested chat routes in router/index.tsx
- Set up chat layout with nested route structure
- Support thread-specific URLs (/graphs/:id/chat/:threadId)
- Add proper route guards and error boundaries
- Maintain consistency with existing router patterns
- Support navigation between chat and graph editor

## Implementation Plan
1. Update frontend/src/router/routes.ts with chat route constants
2. Add placeholder chat components (ChatLayout, ChatInterface, ChatWelcome)
3. Configure nested routes in router/index.tsx
4. Add proper TypeScript interfaces for route parameters
5. Test route navigation and URL patterns

## Test Plan
- Routes resolve correctly with proper parameters
- Navigation between chat routes works
- URL parameters are properly typed
- Error boundaries handle navigation errors
- Chat routes integrate with existing auth flow

## Verification
- [x] Chat routes added to ROUTES constants (GRAPH_CHAT, GRAPH_CHAT_THREAD)
- [x] Nested route structure configured properly with ChatLayout as parent
- [x] Route parameters properly typed with GraphChatParams interface  
- [x] Navigation structure ready for chat routes (placeholder components work)
- [x] Integration with existing router patterns maintained (follows AppLayout pattern)
- [x] TypeScript compilation passes for route configuration
- [x] All required components created (ChatLayout, ChatInterface, ChatWelcome)
