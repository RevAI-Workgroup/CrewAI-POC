# [3-5] Thread Router Implementation

## Description
Implement complete FastAPI router for thread management with all CRUD endpoints and comprehensive error handling. This router will handle thread creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion with proper authentication and validation.

## Requirements
1. Create complete thread router in `backend/routers/threads.py`
2. Implement all CRUD endpoints:
   - POST `/threads/` - Create thread
   - GET `/threads/{thread_id}` - Get specific thread
   - GET `/threads/graph/{graph_id}` - Get all threads for graph
   - PUT `/threads/{thread_id}` - Update thread
   - DELETE `/threads/{thread_id}` - Soft delete thread
3. Use existing ThreadService from task 3-4
4. Use thread schemas from task 3-3
5. Follow existing authentication patterns (JWT with get_current_user)
6. Comprehensive error handling with proper HTTP status codes
7. Proper logging throughout
8. Register router in main.py

## Implementation Plan
1. Check existing routers for patterns and dependencies
2. Verify ThreadService and schemas are available
3. Create complete threads.py router with all endpoints
4. Add proper imports and dependencies
5. Implement comprehensive error handling
6. Register router in main.py
7. Test all endpoints manually

## Test Plan
**Objectives**: Verify all thread CRUD operations work correctly with proper error handling and authentication.

**Test Scenarios**:
1. Create thread with valid graph - should succeed
2. Create thread with invalid graph - should return 400/404
3. Get thread by ID with valid access - should return thread
4. Get thread by ID without access - should return 403
5. Get graph threads with valid graph - should return list
6. Update thread with valid data - should update successfully
7. Delete thread with valid access - should soft delete
8. All endpoints with invalid authentication - should return 401

**Success Criteria**: All endpoints respond correctly with proper status codes and error messages.

## Verification
- [x] All CRUD endpoints implemented
- [x] Error handling covers all failure cases
- [x] Authentication required for all endpoints
- [x] Router registered in main.py
- [ ] Manual testing passes for all scenarios

## Files Modified
- `backend/routers/threads.py` (new)
- `backend/main.py` (router registration)

## Dependencies
- Task 3-3: Thread schemas (completed)
- Task 3-4: ThreadService (completed)
- Existing authentication system
- Existing error handling patterns
