# [3-12] Execution Record Management During Streaming

## Description
Implement comprehensive execution record management during chat streaming operations. This includes creating execution records before streaming starts, updating them during the process, linking them to messages, and proper transaction management throughout the streaming lifecycle.

## Requirements

### Core Functionality
- **Execution Record Creation**: Create execution records before streaming starts
- **Message-Execution Linking**: Link assistant messages to execution records
- **Status Updates**: Update execution status throughout streaming lifecycle
- **Transaction Management**: Handle database operations safely during streaming
- **Error Handling**: Proper cleanup on execution failures
- **Progress Tracking**: Track execution progress and intermediate states

### Technical Requirements
- **Database Safety**: Ensure ACID compliance during streaming operations
- **Status Transitions**: Use ExecutionStatus enum for valid state transitions
- **Timing Tracking**: Record start/completion timestamps accurately
- **Result Storage**: Store execution results and error information
- **Rollback Support**: Handle partial failures with proper cleanup

### Integration Points
- **Execution Model**: Use existing Execution model with proper status management
- **Message Model**: Link messages to executions via execution_id
- **Chat Streaming**: Integrate with existing chat streaming endpoint
- **Error Services**: Use ExecutionStatusService for status management

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Enhanced Execution Creation
- Create execution record with proper initial state
- Set execution_config with chat-specific metadata
- Link to triggering message and thread context

### 2. Streaming Integration
- Update execution status at streaming milestones
- Track progress percentage during execution
- Store intermediate results and logs

### 3. Transaction Management
- Use database transactions for atomic operations
- Handle rollback scenarios on failures
- Ensure data consistency during concurrent operations

### 4. Status Lifecycle Management
- PENDING → RUNNING → COMPLETED/FAILED transitions
- Proper timestamp tracking for each phase
- Error message and detail storage on failures

### 5. Message-Execution Synchronization
- Link assistant messages to execution records
- Update message status based on execution progress
- Maintain consistency between message and execution states

## Test Plan

### Unit Tests
- Execution record creation with valid data
- Status transition validation and edge cases
- Message-execution linking functionality
- Transaction rollback scenarios
- Error handling and cleanup operations

### Integration Tests
- Full streaming lifecycle with execution tracking
- Concurrent execution prevention
- Database consistency during failures
- Message-execution synchronization
- Performance under load conditions

### Error Scenarios
- Database connection failures during streaming
- Partial execution failures requiring rollback
- Concurrent access to same execution record
- Invalid status transitions
- Memory/resource exhaustion scenarios

## Verification

### Success Criteria
- [x] Execution records created before streaming starts
- [x] Proper status transitions throughout lifecycle
- [x] Message-execution linking works correctly
- [x] Database transactions maintain consistency
- [x] Error scenarios handled with proper cleanup
- [x] Timing information accurately recorded
- [x] Progress tracking functional
- [x] Result data stored correctly

### Performance Criteria
- [ ] Minimal overhead on streaming performance
- [ ] Database operations optimized for streaming
- [ ] Memory usage remains bounded
- [ ] No resource leaks during long executions

## Files Modified

### Backend Files
- `backend/routers/messages.py` - Enhanced execution management in streaming endpoint
- `backend/services/execution_record_service.py` - New service for execution lifecycle management
- `backend/models/execution.py` - Ensure proper status management methods
- `backend/models/message.py` - Enhanced execution linking methods
- Tests: `tests/services/test_execution_record_service.py` - New test suite

### Dependencies
- Requires completed tasks: 3-10 (Chat Streaming Endpoint), 3-11 (Dynamic Task Creation)
- Integrates with: ExecutionStatusService, MessageProcessingService
- Prepares for: Task 3-13 (Error Handling Implementation)
