# [3-17] Chat Service Implementation

## Description
Implement HTTP streaming service for frontend chat functionality. This service will handle all API communication with the backend chat endpoints, including thread management and streaming message responses from CrewAI execution.

| 2024-12-27 | complete_implementation | Agreed | Done | Chat service with HTTP streaming implemented | AI_Agent |

## Requirements
- Create chatService.ts with all thread and message API operations
- Implement HTTP streaming for chat messages using fetch API
- Replace placeholder implementations in chatStore with real API calls
- Add proper error handling and response parsing
- Support authentication with JWT tokens
- Follow existing service patterns (authService, apiService)
- Handle streaming response parsing for CrewAI execution
- Add request/response transformation utilities
- Implement retry logic for failed requests

## Implementation Plan
1. Create `frontend/src/services/chatService.ts`
2. Implement thread management API calls (CRUD operations)
3. Implement message API calls with streaming support
4. Add HTTP streaming handler for real-time chat responses
5. Update chatStore to use real service instead of placeholders
6. Add error handling and response transformation
7. Test service functionality with backend endpoints

## Test Plan
- Unit tests for service methods
- Test streaming response handling
- Test error scenarios and retry logic
- Integration tests with actual backend endpoints
- Test authentication and authorization
- Validate request/response transformations

## Verification
- All API endpoints properly called
- Streaming responses handled correctly
- Error handling provides meaningful feedback
- Authentication tokens included in requests
- Chat store integration works seamlessly
- No placeholder implementations remain

## Files Modified
- `frontend/src/services/chatService.ts` (new)
- `frontend/src/stores/chatStore.ts` (updated to use real service)
- `frontend/src/services/index.ts` (updated exports)
