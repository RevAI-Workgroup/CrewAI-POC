# [3-4] ThreadService Implementation

**Parent Task List**: [Tasks for PBI-003](mdc:../tasks.md)

## Description

Implement complete ThreadService with CRUD operations and validation for the chat interface. This service will handle all thread management business logic, validation, and database operations, providing a clean interface for the thread management endpoints.

## Requirements

### Core Service Operations
1. **Create Thread** - Create new threads with graph validation
2. **Get Thread** - Retrieve thread by ID with user validation
3. **Update Thread** - Update thread properties with validation
4. **Delete Thread** - Soft delete threads with cleanup
5. **List Threads** - Get user's threads with pagination and filtering

### Validation Requirements
- Graph ID existence validation
- User ownership validation for all operations
- Thread name length and format validation
- Status transition validation
- Configuration schema validation

### Business Logic Requirements
- Single crew per graph enforcement
- Thread status management
- Proper error handling and messages
- Database transaction management
- Audit trail for thread operations

### Integration Requirements
- Compatible with existing Thread model
- Uses thread schemas from task 3-3
- SQLAlchemy session management
- Proper dependency injection patterns

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Service Foundation
- Create ThreadService class structure
- Setup dependency injection for database
- Implement base service patterns

### Step 2: CRUD Operations Implementation
- create_thread() method with validation
- get_thread() with ownership checks
- update_thread() with partial updates
- delete_thread() with proper cleanup
- list_threads() with filtering/pagination

### Step 3: Validation Logic
- Graph existence validation service
- User ownership validation helpers
- Thread configuration validation
- Status transition validation

### Step 4: Error Handling
- Custom exception classes
- Proper error messages
- Database error handling
- Transaction rollback management

### Step 5: Testing Integration
- Unit test structure preparation
- Mock setup for dependencies
- Test data preparation helpers

## Test Plan

### Unit Tests
- Each CRUD operation independently
- Validation logic testing
- Error condition handling
- Mock database interactions

### Integration Tests
- Database transaction testing
- Schema validation integration
- Multi-operation scenarios
- Concurrency handling

### Validation Tests
- Graph ID validation scenarios
- User ownership enforcement
- Thread configuration validation
- Status transition rules
