# [3-7] Execution Protection

## Description
Implement execution protection service to prevent concurrent crew executions for the same graph. This ensures that only one crew can run at a time per graph to avoid resource conflicts and maintain data consistency.

## Status History
- **2024-12-27**: Task created - Proposed
- **2024-12-27**: Task started - InProgress
- **2024-12-27**: Task completed - Done

## Requirements
1. ✓ Create `ExecutionProtectionService` to manage concurrent execution protection
2. ✓ Implement graph-level execution locking mechanism
3. ✓ Check for running executions before starting new ones
4. ✓ Provide clear error messages when concurrent execution is attempted
5. ✓ Support graceful handling of edge cases (timeouts, failures)
6. ✓ Integrate with existing `ExecutionStatusService`
7. ✓ Add proper logging for protection events

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Protection Service ✓
- ✓ Create `ExecutionProtectionService` class
- ✓ Implement graph-level execution checking
- ✓ Add protection validation methods
- ✓ Create lock acquisition/release mechanism

### Phase 2: Integration ✓
- ✓ Integrate with existing execution flow
- ✓ Add protection to thread service
- ✓ Update execution status service integration
- ✓ Add proper error handling

### Phase 3: Edge Cases ✓
- ✓ Handle execution timeouts
- ✓ Cleanup orphaned locks
- ✓ Manage concurrent access to protection service
- ✓ Add fallback mechanisms

## Test Plan
- Unit tests for protection service
- Integration tests with existing execution flow
- Edge case testing (timeouts, failures)
- Concurrent access testing
- Cleanup mechanism testing

## Verification
- [x] Service prevents concurrent executions for same graph
- [x] Clear error messages when protection triggered
- [x] Proper lock cleanup on execution completion
- [x] Integration with existing execution services
- [x] Edge case handling works correctly

## Files Modified

- `backend/services/thread_service.py` (updated) ✓
- `backend/services/execution_status_service.py` (updated) ✓

## Implementation Summary
- Created `ExecutionProtectionService` with thread-safe locking
- Implemented graph-level execution protection with in-memory and database validation
- Added automatic lock release when executions complete
- Integrated with `ThreadService` for execution validation
- Added protection hooks in `ExecutionStatusService` for automatic lock management
- Implemented cleanup mechanisms for orphaned/stuck executions
- Added comprehensive error handling and logging
