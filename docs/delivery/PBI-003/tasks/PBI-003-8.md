# [PBI-003-8] Thread Management Testing Suite

## Description

Implement comprehensive testing suite for thread management functionality including ThreadService, thread endpoints, validation services, and error handling. This ensures reliability and correctness of the thread management system built in tasks 3-3 through 3-7.

**Parent Task List**: [Tasks for PBI-003](mdc:../tasks.md)

## Requirements

### Testing Coverage Required:
1. **ThreadService Unit Tests:**
   - CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete)
   - Access control and validation
   - Graph validation integration
   - Execution protection integration
   - Status transitions and thread lifecycle
   - Error handling and edge cases

2. **Thread Router Integration Tests:**
   - All HTTP endpoints with auth
   - Request/response validation
   - Error status codes and messages
   - Access control enforcement

3. **Service Integration Tests:**
   - Graph crew validation service integration
   - Execution protection service integration
   - Database transaction handling

4. **Error Handling Tests:**
   - Invalid input handling
   - Permission errors
   - Database constraint violations
   - Service dependency failures

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: ThreadService Unit Tests
Create comprehensive unit tests for `ThreadService` class covering:
- `create_thread()` with various scenarios
- `get_thread()` and access control
- `get_graph_threads()` and `list_user_threads()`
- `update_thread()` and status transitions
- `delete_thread()` and soft deletion
- Validation methods and error handling

### Phase 2: Thread Router Tests
Create integration tests for thread endpoints:
- POST `/threads` - thread creation
- GET `/threads/{id}` - thread retrieval
- GET `/threads/graph/{graph_id}` - graph threads
- PUT `/threads/{id}` - thread updates
- DELETE `/threads/{id}` - thread deletion
- GET `/threads` - user thread listing

### Phase 3: Service Integration Tests
Test integration with dependent services:
- Graph crew validation service calls
- Execution protection service calls
- Database transaction rollback scenarios

### Phase 4: Error Handling and Edge Cases
Comprehensive error scenario testing:
- Malformed requests
- Authorization failures
- Database constraint violations
- Service unavailability

## Test Plan

### Unit Tests (`test_thread_service.py`)
- Test all ThreadService methods with valid inputs
- Test validation logic and error conditions
- Mock external dependencies (DB, other services)
- Test edge cases and boundary conditions
- Performance validation for list operations

### Integration Tests (`test_thread_router.py`)
- Test HTTP endpoints with real database
- Test authentication and authorization
- Test request/response schemas
- Test error status codes and messages
- Test concurrent request handling

### Success Criteria:
- All tests pass with >95% code coverage
- All error scenarios properly handled
- Performance tests show acceptable response times
- Integration tests validate end-to-end functionality

## Verification
