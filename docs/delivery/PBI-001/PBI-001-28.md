# [1-28] WebSocket Evaluation

**Parent PBI**: [PBI-001: CrewAI Backend API Development](mdc:tasks.md)

## Description

Evaluate WebSocket implementation as an alternative to Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time communication. Compare performance, resource usage, browser compatibility, and implementation complexity between WebSocket and SSE approaches for streaming execution updates.

## Requirements

1. **WebSocket Implementation**
   - Create WebSocket endpoint for real-time communication
   - Implement connection management and cleanup
   - Handle client disconnections gracefully

2. **Performance Comparison**
   - Measure resource usage (memory, CPU) for both approaches
   - Test with multiple concurrent connections (10, 50, 100 clients)
   - Measure latency and throughput differences

3. **Feature Comparison**
   - Browser compatibility analysis
   - Reconnection handling
   - Message delivery guarantees
   - Implementation complexity

4. **Documentation**
   - Performance test results
   - Recommendation report with pros/cons
   - Implementation examples for both approaches

## Implementation Plan

1. **WebSocket Setup**
   - Add WebSocket dependencies to requirements.txt
   - Create WebSocket endpoint in FastAPI
   - Implement connection manager for multiple clients

2. **Performance Testing**
   - Create test scripts for load testing both SSE and WebSocket
   - Measure key metrics under various load conditions
   - Document results in comparison report

3. **Feature Analysis**
   - Test browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
   - Test reconnection scenarios
   - Compare ease of implementation and maintenance

## Test Plan

**Simple Integration Test**: WebSocket connection establishes successfully and can send/receive messages

**Performance Test Objectives**:
- Measure connection overhead for both SSE and WebSocket
- Test with concurrent connections (10, 50, 100 clients)
- Measure message latency and throughput
- Monitor server resource usage

**Success Criteria**:
- WebSocket endpoint works correctly
- Performance comparison report completed
- Clear recommendation provided based on test results

## Verification

- [ ] WebSocket endpoint implemented and functional
- [ ] Performance tests completed for both SSE and WebSocket
- [ ] Comparison report with metrics and recommendation
- [ ] Browser compatibility verified
- [ ] Connection management working properly
