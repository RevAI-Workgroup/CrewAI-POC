# [1-10] Execution Log Model

**Parent Task List**: [Tasks for PBI-001](mdc:tasks.md)

## Description
Implement execution tracking and status management for CrewAI crew executions. The model should track execution lifecycle, results, errors, and performance metrics.

## Status History
- **2024-12-30 20:55**: Task created (Proposed)
- **2024-12-30 20:55**: User approved task (Proposed → Agreed)
- **2024-12-30 20:55**: Started implementation (Agreed → InProgress)
- **2024-12-30 21:05**: Implementation completed (InProgress → Done)

## Requirements
1. Create Execution model with SQLAlchemy
2. Track execution status (pending, running, completed, failed)
3. Store execution results and error information
4. Link executions to messages and graphs
5. Track execution timing and performance metrics
6. Support execution cancellation and cleanup

## Implementation Plan
1. Define Execution model in `backend/models/execution.py`
2. Add relationships to Message and Graph models
3. Create execution status enums
4. Add execution result and error tracking
5. Add database migration
6. Update Message model to enable execution relationship
7. Add to main model imports

## Test Plan
**Objectives**: Verify Execution model creation, status tracking, and relationships
**Scope**: Unit tests for model validation and execution lifecycle
**Environment**: Test database with existing Message and Graph models
**Key Scenarios**:
- Execution creation with valid message/graph reference
- Status transitions (pending → running → completed/failed)
- Result and error storage
- Performance metrics tracking
- Execution-message relationship validation
**Success Criteria**: All tests pass, execution lifecycle works correctly

## Verification
- [x] Execution model created with proper fields
- [x] Database relationships established
- [x] Execution status enums defined
- [x] Migration runs successfully
- [x] Message model updated with execution relationship
- [x] Unit tests pass
- [x] Integration with existing models works
