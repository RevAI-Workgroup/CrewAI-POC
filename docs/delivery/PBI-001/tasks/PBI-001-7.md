# [1-7] Graph Model and CRUD

## Description
Create the Graph model with basic CRUD operations for storing and managing CrewAI graph definitions. This includes the core graph structure with nodes, edges, and metadata required for visual graph building and execution. Note: Workspace is a conceptual collection of threads linked to a graph, not a separate model.

## Requirements
1. Create Graph SQLAlchemy model with proper fields and relationships
2. Support graph metadata (name, description, version, tags)
3. Store graph definition as JSON with nodes and edges
4. Implement user ownership (no separate workspace model)
5. Add basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
6. Include proper validation for graph structure
7. Support soft delete and versioning
8. Add proper indexing for performance
9. Threads will reference graph_id (workspace = collection of threads per graph)

## Implementation Plan
1. **Model Design**: Create Graph SQLAlchemy model
   - Fields: id, name, description, graph_data (JSON), version, tags, user_id
   - Relationships: belongs_to User, has_many Threads
   - Constraints: unique name per user, proper foreign keys

2. **Graph Data Structure**: Define JSON schema for graph_data
   - Nodes: array of node objects with id, type, position, config
   - Edges: array of edge objects with source, target, connection details
   - Metadata: version, created_at, modified_at

3. **CRUD Operations**: Implement basic database operations
   - Create: New graph with validation
   - Read: Get graph by ID, list graphs by user
   - Update: Modify graph data with version increment
   - Delete: Soft delete with archive functionality

4. **Validation**: Input validation and business rules
   - Graph data JSON schema validation
   - Node and edge reference validation
   - User permission checks

## Verification
- [x] Graph model implemented with proper fields and relationships
- [x] JSON graph_data field stores nodes and edges correctly
- [x] CRUD operations implemented and working
- [x] User associations enforced (unique graph names per user)
- [x] Input validation prevents invalid graph storage
- [x] Soft delete functionality implemented
- [x] Database migration created and applied
- [x] Removed incorrect Workspace model (workspace = collection of threads per graph)

## Files Modified
- `backend/models/graph.py` (updated - removed workspace_id)
- `backend/models/__init__.py` (updated - removed Workspace)
- `backend/models/user.py` (updated - removed workspaces relationship)
- `backend/alembic/versions/070860b1bce9_add_workspace_and_graph_models.py` (updated - only graphs table)
