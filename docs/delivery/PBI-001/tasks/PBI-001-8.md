# [1-8] Thread Model

## Description
Implement Thread model for managing conversation threads within graphs. A thread represents a workspace or conversation session where users can interact with a specific graph instance. Each thread is linked to a graph, and a graph can have many threads.

## Status History
- **2024-12-19 21:30**: Task Proposed → Agreed (User approval)
- **2024-12-19 21:30**: Task Agreed → InProgress (Starting implementation)
- **2024-12-19 21:45**: Task InProgress → Done (Thread model implemented and tested)

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. Thread model with relationship to Graph
2. Thread metadata (name, description, status)
3. Thread management capabilities (create, update, soft delete)
4. User ownership and access control
5. Thread-to-graph association validation

### Technical Requirements
1. SQLAlchemy model inheriting from BaseModel
2. Foreign key relationship to Graph model
3. User ownership through graph relationship
4. Thread status tracking (active, archived, deleted)
5. Timestamps for creation and last activity
6. Thread-specific configuration storage

### Database Schema
```sql
threads (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    graph_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES graphs(id),
    name VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'active',
    thread_config JSON,
    last_activity_at TIMESTAMP,
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
)
```

## Implementation Plan

1. **Create Thread Model** (`backend/models/thread.py`)
   - Implement Thread class with all required fields
   - Add relationship to Graph model
   - Implement validation methods
   - Add access control methods

2. **Update Graph Model**
   - Add threads relationship to Graph model
   - Ensure cascade delete configuration

3. **Update Models Init**
   - Import Thread model in models/__init__.py
   - Ensure proper model registration

4. **Model Testing**
   - Create basic instances
   - Test relationships
   - Validate constraints

## Test Plan

### Unit Tests
1. **Model Creation**: Create Thread instances with valid data
2. **Validation**: Test required field validation
3. **Relationships**: Verify Graph-Thread relationship
4. **Access Control**: Test ownership and access methods
5. **Status Management**: Test status transitions
6. **Configuration**: Test thread_config JSON storage

### Integration Tests
1. **Database Operations**: Create, read, update threads
2. **Cascade Operations**: Verify graph deletion cascades to threads
3. **Constraint Validation**: Test database constraints

### Success Criteria
- Thread model compiles without errors
- All relationships work correctly
- Basic CRUD operations succeed
- Tests pass with good coverage

## Verification
- [x] Thread model created in `backend/models/thread.py`
- [x] Graph model updated with threads relationship
- [x] Models properly imported in `__init__.py`
- [x] Unit tests pass
- [x] Integration tests pass
- [x] No import or compilation errors

## Files Modified
- `backend/models/thread.py` (created)
- `backend/models/graph.py` (updated relationships)
- `backend/models/__init__.py` (updated imports)
