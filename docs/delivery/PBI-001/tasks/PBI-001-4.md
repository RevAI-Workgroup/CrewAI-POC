# [Task 1-4] Authentication Models

## Description
Implement User model with pseudo/passphrase authentication and JWT token management system. This provides the foundation for user authentication throughout the API.

## Requirements
1. ✅ User model with pseudo (non-unique) and passphrase (unique) fields
2. ✅ Unique passphrase generation in format: `word-word-word-word-word-word`
3. ✅ JWT token generation and validation utilities
4. ✅ User authentication schema models for pseudo/passphrase system
5. ✅ Passphrase validation and uniqueness checking
6. ✅ API key association with users (prepared for future)
7. ✅ Role-based access control foundation
8. ✅ Removed unnecessary profile fields for simplified user model

## Implementation Plan
1. ✅ Create User SQLAlchemy model with pseudo and passphrase fields
2. ✅ Implement passphrase generation utilities (6 hyphenated words)
3. ✅ Create JWT token generation and validation functions
4. ✅ Define Pydantic schemas for pseudo/passphrase authentication
5. ✅ Add user role enumeration for future access control
6. ✅ Setup authentication dependency injection for passphrase-only login
7. ✅ Add passphrase uniqueness validation

## Test Plan
**Objective**: Verify User model creation, passphrase generation, and JWT token functionality

**Test Scenarios**:
1. User model creates and stores correctly with pseudo/passphrase
2. Passphrases are generated in correct format and are unique
3. JWT tokens are generated and validated correctly
4. User schemas serialize/deserialize properly for new auth system
5. Authentication dependencies work with passphrase-only login

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ User can be created with generated unique passphrase
- ✅ Passphrase format is `word-word-word-word-word-word`
- ✅ JWT tokens contain correct claims and can be decoded
- ✅ Pydantic schemas validate pseudo/passphrase data properly
- ✅ Authentication utilities are ready for passphrase-only endpoint use

## Verification
**Implementation Status**: ✅ Complete

**Files Created/Modified**:
- ✅ `backend/models/user.py` - User model with pseudo/passphrase fields and methods
- ✅ `backend/utils/auth.py` - JWT token utilities and passphrase generation
- ✅ `backend/schemas/auth.py` - Pydantic schemas for pseudo/passphrase authentication
- ✅ `backend/utils/dependencies.py` - FastAPI authentication dependencies for passphrase system
- ✅ `backend/schemas/__init__.py` - Schema package initialization
- ✅ `backend/models/__init__.py` - Updated with User model exports

**Key Features Implemented**:
1. **User Model**: Pseudo/passphrase authentication model with roles and profile fields
2. **Security**: Unique passphrase generation with 6 hyphenated words
3. **JWT Management**: Access/refresh token creation and validation
4. **Schemas**: Comprehensive Pydantic models for pseudo/passphrase auth operations
5. **Dependencies**: FastAPI auth dependencies for passphrase-only protected routes
6. **Role System**: Admin/User roles with permission checking

## Files Modified
- `backend/models/user.py` - User pseudo/passphrase authentication model
- `backend/utils/auth.py` - Authentication utilities with passphrase generation
- `backend/schemas/auth.py` - Pseudo/passphrase authentication schemas
- `backend/utils/dependencies.py` - Passphrase authentication dependencies
- `backend/schemas/__init__.py` - Schema package
- `backend/models/__init__.py` - Model exports

## Notes
- User model uses pseudo (non-unique) and passphrase (unique) instead of email/password
- Passphrase format: `backstage-epileptic-wimp-petunia-outpost-undergrad` (6 hyphenated words)
- Login requires only passphrase (not pseudo + passphrase)
- JWT tokens support both access and refresh token types
- Role-based access control ready for future endpoint protection
- Passphrase uniqueness enforced at database level
- Dependencies framework prepared for integration with FastAPI routes
