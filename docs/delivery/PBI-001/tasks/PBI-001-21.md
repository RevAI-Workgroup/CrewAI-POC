# [1-21] Async Execution Service

**Parent PBI**: [PBI-001: CrewAI Backend API Development](mdc:../prd.md)  
**Task Index**: [Tasks for PBI-001](mdc:../tasks.md)

## Description

Implement Celery-based async execution service to handle CrewAI crew execution in background. This service will queue execution requests, process them asynchronously, and provide status tracking capabilities.

## Status History

| Timestamp | Event | From_Status | To_Status | Details | User |

| 2024-12-27 | user_approves | Proposed | Agreed | Task approved for implementation | User |
| 2024-12-27 | start_work | Agreed | InProgress | Beginning Celery implementation | AI_Agent |
| 2024-12-27 | submit_for_review | InProgress | Review | Async execution service implemented | AI_Agent |

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Celery worker configuration with Redis broker
- Async task for crew execution using CrewAI integration
- Task result backend for status and output storage
- Queue management with priority levels
- Error handling and retry logic
- Task cancellation support

### Technical Requirements
- Use Celery 5.x with Redis as broker and result backend
- Integrate with existing graph_execution_service
- Store execution status in ExecutionLog model
- Support for task metadata and progress tracking
- Proper error serialization and logging

### Dependencies
- Task 1-20: Graph to CrewAI Translation (Done)
- Redis server for Celery broker
- Existing ExecutionLog model
- Graph validation service

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Celery Configuration
- Install and configure Celery with Redis
- Create celery app configuration
- Setup worker configuration

### Step 2: Async Execution Task
- Create async task for crew execution
- Integrate with graph_execution_service
- Add progress tracking and status updates

### Step 3: Queue Management
- Implement task queuing with priorities
- Add task cancellation functionality
- Setup retry logic and error handling

### Step 4: Integration
- Update execution endpoints to use async tasks
- Add task status endpoints
- Test async execution flow

## Test Plan

### Unit Tests
- Celery task execution logic
- Error handling and retry mechanisms
- Task status tracking

### Integration Tests
- Full async execution workflow
- Queue management functionality
- Integration with existing services

### Success Criteria
- Crew execution runs asynchronously in background
- Task status properly tracked in database
- Error handling works for failed executions
- Queue management supports cancellation and retries

## Verification

- [x] Celery app configuration created with Redis broker
- [x] Async crew execution task implemented
- [x] Task status tracking implemented in Execution model
- [x] Error handling with retry logic implemented
- [x] Queue management with cancellation support
- [x] Unit tests created
- [ ] Integration tests pass (requires Redis setup)
- [ ] Manual testing with Celery worker
