# [1-15] Graph CRUD Endpoints and Node Definition Structure

## Description
Implement REST endpoints for graph management operations and create a Node Definition structure endpoint. The Node Definition structure endpoint provides the frontend with metadata about all available node types including field requirements, default values, field types, and possible options for rendering the sidebar and forms.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. **Node Definition Structure Endpoint**: GET `/api/graph-nodes`
   - Returns metadata for all node types (Crew, Agent, Task, LLM providers: OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama)
   - Includes field requirements, default display settings, field types with options
   - Includes connection constraints for each node type
   - Supports frontend sidebar rendering and form generation

2. **Graph CRUD Endpoints**: Complete REST API for graph operations
   - GET `/api/graphs` - List user's graphs
   - GET `/api/graphs/{id}` - Get specific graph
   - POST `/api/graphs` - Create new graph
   - PUT `/api/graphs/{id}` - Update graph
   - DELETE `/api/graphs/{id}` - Delete graph

### Technical Requirements
- Use FastAPI router pattern
- JWT authentication for all endpoints
- Proper error handling with HTTP status codes
- Type hints throughout
- Based on existing Node models and schemas

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Create Node Definition Structure Service ✅
- Create service to generate node type metadata
- Include field validation rules, types, options
- Define connection constraints per node type

### Step 2: Create Graph Router ✅
- Implement FastAPI router with all CRUD endpoints
- Add authentication dependency
- Include proper error handling

### Step 3: Node Definition Structure Endpoint ✅
- Implement GET endpoint returning structured metadata
- Format for frontend consumption (sidebar + forms)

### Step 4: Integration ✅
- Register router in main application
- Test all endpoints

## Test Plan

### Unit Tests ✅
- Test node definition structure generation service
- Test graph CRUD operations with mocked database
- Test authentication integration
- Test error handling scenarios

### Integration Tests ✅
- Test all endpoints with real database
- Test JWT authentication flow
- Test graph creation and validation integration
- Test node definition structure response format

### Success Criteria ✅
- All endpoints return proper HTTP status codes
- Node definition structure supports frontend rendering
- Graph operations work with existing models
- Authentication properly restricts access
- Error responses are informative

## Verification
- [x] Node definition structure endpoint returns complete metadata
- [x] All graph CRUD endpoints implemented and tested
- [x] Authentication working on all endpoints
- [x] Connection constraints included in node definitions
- [x] Frontend can consume the structure for sidebar/forms
- [x] Proper error handling implemented
