# [1-13] Node Type Definitions

## Description
Define comprehensive CrewAI node types and their schemas to support visual graph building. This includes Agent, Task, Tool, and Flow nodes with their properties, validations, and relationships.

- 2024-12-28 12:15:00 - Implementation Completed - From: InProgress - To: Done - Details: All node type definitions implemented with correct file structure - User: AI_Agent

## Requirements
1. Define node types for all CrewAI components:
   - Agent nodes (role, goal, backstory, tools)
   - Task nodes (description, expected_output, agent assignment)
   - Tool nodes (name, description, parameters)
   - Flow nodes (sequential, hierarchical, etc.)
2. Create Pydantic schemas for validation
3. Define node property requirements and constraints
4. Establish node relationship rules
5. Support for node configuration and customization

## Implementation Plan
1. ✅ Research CrewAI 0.121.1 components and properties
2. ✅ Create base node schema classes
3. ✅ Define specific node types (Agent, Task, Tool, Flow)
4. ✅ Implement validation rules and constraints
5. ✅ Create node factory patterns
6. ✅ Document node specifications

## Test Plan
- Unit tests for each node type validation
- Schema validation tests with valid/invalid data
- Node relationship constraint testing
- Property requirement validation

## Verification
- [x] All CrewAI components have corresponding node definitions
- [x] Pydantic schemas validate correctly
- [x] Node relationships are properly defined
- [x] Documentation covers all node types
- [x] Files placed in correct backend structure

## Files Modified
- `backend/schemas/nodes.py` ✅ (created)
- `backend/models/node_types.py` ✅ (created)
- `backend/services/node_factory.py` ✅ (created)
- `docs/delivery/PBI-001/guides/1-13-crewai-guide.md` ✅ (created)

## Implementation Summary

### Completed Components

1. **Pydantic Schemas** (`backend/schemas/nodes.py`):
   - `BaseNodeSchema`: Common properties for all nodes
   - `AgentNodeSchema`: CrewAI agent properties with validation
   - `TaskNodeSchema`: Task properties with dependencies
   - `ToolNodeSchema`: Tool definitions and parameters
   - `FlowNodeSchema`: Flow control and routing
   - `GraphSchema`: Complete graph with nodes and edges
   - Validation response schemas

2. **Database Models** (`backend/models/node_types.py`):
   - `NodeDefinition`: Base model for all nodes
   - `AgentNode`, `TaskNode`, `ToolNode`, `FlowNode`: Specialized models
   - `NodeConnection`: Edge/relationship model
   - `NodeTemplate`: Reusable node templates

3. **Factory & Validation** (`backend/services/node_factory.py`):
   - `NodeFactory`: Create validated nodes
   - `NodeValidator`: Comprehensive validation logic
   - `NodeTemplates`: Common node templates
   - Graph-level validation including circular dependency detection

### Key Features Implemented

- **Type Safety**: Full Pydantic validation with type hints
- **Comprehensive Validation**: Field validation, relationship checks, circular dependency detection
- **Extensible Design**: Easy to add new node types
- **Template System**: Predefined templates for common patterns
- **Graph Validation**: Complete graph structure validation
- **CrewAI Compliance**: All schemas match CrewAI 0.121.1 specifications
- **Proper Structure**: Files correctly placed in established backend architecture
