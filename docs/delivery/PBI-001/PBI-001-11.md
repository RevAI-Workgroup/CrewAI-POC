# [1-11] Metrics Model

**Parent Task List**: [Tasks for PBI-001](mdc:tasks.md)

## Description
Create model for MLFlow metrics integration to track execution performance, resource usage, and system metrics. The model should support various metric types and enable analytics and monitoring.

## Status History
- **2024-12-30 21:10**: Task created (Proposed)
- **2024-12-30 21:10**: User approved task (Proposed → Agreed)
- **2024-12-30 21:10**: Started implementation (Agreed → InProgress)
- **2024-12-30 21:15**: Implementation completed, all tests passed (InProgress → Done)

## Requirements
1. Create Metrics model with SQLAlchemy
2. Support different metric types (counter, gauge, histogram)
3. Link metrics to executions and users
4. Store metric values with timestamps
5. Support metric metadata and tags
6. Enable aggregation and querying capabilities

## Implementation Plan
1. Define Metrics model in `backend/models/metrics.py`
2. Add relationships to Execution and User models
3. Create metric type enums
4. Add metric value storage with proper data types
5. Add database migration
6. Add to main model imports
7. Create basic metric collection utilities

## Test Plan
**Objectives**: Verify Metrics model creation, data storage, and relationships
**Scope**: Unit tests for model validation and metric operations
**Environment**: Test database with existing Execution and User models
**Key Scenarios**:
- Metric creation with different types
- Metric-execution relationship validation
- Metric value storage and retrieval
- Timestamp handling
- Metadata and tags functionality
**Success Criteria**: All tests pass, metrics can be stored and queried

## Verification
- [x] Metrics model created with proper fields
- [x] Database relationships established
- [x] Metric types properly defined
- [x] Migration runs successfully
- [x] Unit tests pass
- [x] Integration with existing models works

## Files Modified
- `backend/models/metrics.py` (new)
- `backend/models/__init__.py` (updated)
- `backend/models/execution.py` (updated relationships)
- `backend/models/user.py` (updated relationships)
- `backend/alembic/versions/7b415b971f41_add_metrics_model.py` (new migration)
