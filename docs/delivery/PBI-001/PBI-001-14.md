# [1-14] Graph Validation Service

## Description
Implement core graph validation logic that ensures CrewAI graphs are structurally sound, semantically valid, and ready for execution. This service builds on the node type definitions from task 1-13 and provides comprehensive validation for complex graph structures.

## Requirements
1. **Structural Validation**:
   - Verify graph connectivity and reachability
   - Detect and prevent circular dependencies
   - Validate node relationships and edge constraints
   - Ensure proper entry and exit points

2. **Semantic Validation**:
   - Verify CrewAI compatibility for all nodes
   - Validate agent-task assignments
   - Check tool availability and permissions
   - Ensure flow control logic is sound

3. **Business Rule Validation**:
   - Enforce maximum graph complexity limits
   - Validate resource requirements
   - Check API key requirements for tools
   - Ensure proper role assignments

4. **Validation Response System**:
   - Detailed error reporting with line numbers
   - Warning system for potential issues
   - Validation severity levels (error, warning, info)
   - Actionable fix suggestions

## Implementation Plan
1. Create core validation service class
2. Implement structural validation algorithms
3. Add CrewAI semantic validation rules
4. Create validation response schemas
5. Add performance optimizations for large graphs
6. Implement validation caching mechanisms

## Test Plan
- Unit tests for each validation rule
- Integration tests with complex graph structures
- Performance tests with large graphs (100+ nodes)
- Edge case testing (empty graphs, single nodes, circular references)
- CrewAI compatibility validation tests

## Verification
- [x] All structural validation rules implemented
- [x] CrewAI semantic validation working
- [x] Detailed error reporting functional
- [x] Performance optimized for large graphs
- [x] Test suite covers all validation scenarios
