   - Detect and prevent circular dependencies
   - Validate node relationships and edge constraints
   - Ensure proper entry and exit points

2. **Semantic Validation**:
   - Verify CrewAI compatibility for all nodes
   - Validate agent-task assignments
   - Check tool availability and permissions
   - Ensure flow control logic is sound
   - Validate LLM configuration and parameters

3. **Business Rule Validation**:

   - Check API key requirements for tools and LLMs
   - Ensure proper role assignments

4. **Validation Response System**:
   - Detailed error reporting with line numbers
   - Warning system for potential issues
   - Validation severity levels (error, warning, info)
   - Actionable fix suggestions

## Implementation Plan
1. Create core validation service class
2. Implement structural validation algorithms
3. Add CrewAI semantic validation rules
4. Create validation response schemas
5. Add performance optimizations for large graphs
6. Implement validation caching mechanisms
7. Add LLM node validation support

## Test Plan

- [x] CrewAI semantic validation working
- [x] Detailed error reporting functional
- [x] Performance optimized for large graphs
- [x] Test suite covers all validation scenarios
- [x] LLM node validation implemented
