# [1-1] Project Structure and Environment Setup

**Parent**: [Tasks for PBI-001](mdc:../tasks.md)

## Description
Initialize the backend directory structure, setup Python virtual environment, and create basic requirements.txt with FastAPI and core dependencies.

## Status History
- 2024-12-27 10:10 UTC - user_approves - Proposed -> Agreed - User approved task
- 2024-12-27 10:10 UTC - start_work - Agreed -> InProgress - Starting implementation
- 2024-12-27 10:15 UTC - submit_for_review - InProgress -> Review - Implementation complete, all tests passed
- 2024-12-27 10:15 UTC - approve - Review -> Done - Task completed successfully

## Requirements
1. Create `backend/` directory structure following FastAPI best practices
2. Setup Python virtual environment in backend directory
3. Create requirements.txt with initial dependencies:
   - FastAPI
   - SQLAlchemy
   - psycopg2-binary
   - python-jose
   - passlib
   - bcrypt
   - python-multipart
   - uvicorn
4. Create basic project structure with placeholder files
5. Setup .env.example for environment variables
6. Create .gitignore for Python projects

## Implementation Plan
1. Create backend directory and subdirectories
2. Initialize virtual environment
3. Create requirements.txt with core dependencies
4. Setup basic file structure (main.py, models/, routers/, etc.)
5. Create environment configuration files
6. Test environment setup by installing dependencies

## Test Plan
**Objectives**: Verify project structure and environment setup
**Scope**: Backend directory structure, virtual environment, dependency installation
**Environment**: Windows with PowerShell
**Success Criteria**:
- Backend directory exists with proper structure
- Virtual environment activates successfully
- All dependencies install without errors
- Python imports work for core packages

## Verification
- [x] Backend directory structure created
- [x] Virtual environment setup and activated
- [x] Requirements.txt contains all specified dependencies
- [x] Dependencies install successfully
- [x] env.example and .gitignore created
- [x] Basic FastAPI structure in place
