# [1-26] Real-time Status Updates

## Description
Integrate SSE implementation with execution services to provide live execution status updates. This connects the execution pipeline with real-time event broadcasting to notify connected clients of execution progress, completion, and errors.

## Status History
| Timestamp | Event | From_Status | To_Status | Details | User |
|-----------|-------|-------------|-----------|---------|------|
| 2024-01-20 10:00:00 | created | - | Proposed | Task created for real-time status updates | User |
| 2024-01-20 10:05:00 | approved | Proposed | Agreed | Task approved for implementation | User |
| 2024-01-20 10:30:00 | started | Agreed | InProgress | Started real-time status updates implementation | AI_Agent |
| 2024-01-20 11:00:00 | completed | InProgress | Done | Real-time status updates completed | AI_Agent |

## Requirements
1. **Execution Integration**: Connect execution services to SSE broadcasting
2. **Status Events**: Broadcast execution lifecycle events (start, progress, complete, error)
3. **Progress Updates**: Real-time progress percentage and step updates
4. **User Filtering**: Only send updates to authorized users
5. **Event Persistence**: Optional event storage for replay/history
6. **Performance**: Efficient broadcasting without blocking execution

## Implementation Plan
1. Modify execution services to emit SSE events
2. Add execution event listeners to broadcast updates
3. Implement user authorization for execution updates
4. Add progress tracking with percentage and step information
5. Test integration between execution and SSE services
6. Performance optimization for high-frequency updates

## Test Plan
### Objectives
- Verify execution events broadcast correctly via SSE
- Test real-time progress updates during execution
- Validate user authorization and filtering
- Test performance under load

### Test Scenarios
1. **Execution Integration**
   - Start execution and receive start event
   - Progress updates during execution
   - Completion event with results
   - Error event on execution failure

2. **Authorization**
   - User receives their execution updates
   - User doesn't receive other users' updates
   - Admin user receives all updates
   - Invalid user gets no updates

3. **Performance**
   - Multiple concurrent executions
   - High-frequency progress updates
   - Execution not blocked by SSE
   - Memory usage within limits

### Success Criteria
- Execution events broadcast in real-time
- Proper user filtering and authorization
- No performance degradation in execution
- All test scenarios passing

## Verification
- [x] Execution start events broadcast correctly
- [x] Progress updates sent during execution
- [x] Completion events with proper data
- [x] Error events on execution failure
- [x] User authorization working
- [x] Performance tests passing
- [x] All integration tests passing
