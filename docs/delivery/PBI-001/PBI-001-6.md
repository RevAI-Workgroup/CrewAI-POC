# [1-6] API Key Storage Model and Encryption

## Description
Implement a secure API key storage model that allows users to store and manage encrypted API keys (such as OpenAI API keys) for use in CrewAI executions. This builds on the existing User and authentication models from tasks 1-4 and 1-5.

## Status History
- 2024-12-27 15:30 UTC - user_approves - Proposed → Agreed - User approved task for implementation
- 2024-12-27 15:45 UTC - start_work - Agreed → InProgress - Started implementation of APIKey model and encryption
- 2024-12-27 16:00 UTC - submit_for_review - InProgress → Done - Implementation completed and committed

## Requirements
1. Create APIKey model with proper relationships to User model
2. Implement encryption/decryption for sensitive API key values
3. Support multiple API key types (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
4. Add CRUD operations for API key management
5. Ensure proper validation and error handling
6. Include soft delete functionality for security
7. Add proper indexing for performance

## Implementation Plan
1. **Model Design**: Create APIKey SQLAlchemy model with encryption
   - Fields: id, user_id, name, key_type, encrypted_value, created_at, updated_at, is_active
   - Relationships: belongs_to User
   - Encryption: Use cryptography library for Fernet encryption

2. **Encryption Service**: Implement secure key encryption/decryption
   - Generate/manage encryption key from environment variable
   - Encrypt on save, decrypt on retrieval
   - Handle encryption errors gracefully

3. **CRUD Operations**: Basic create, read, update, delete functions
   - Create new API key with encryption
   - List user's API keys (without revealing values)
   - Update API key (re-encrypt if value changed)
   - Soft delete for security audit trail

4. **Validation**: Input validation and security checks
   - Validate API key format per type
   - Ensure unique names per user
   - Validate user ownership

## Test Plan
**Objectives**: Verify secure API key storage with proper encryption
**Scope**: Unit tests for model and encryption, integration tests for CRUD
**Environment**: Test database with test encryption keys

**Key Test Scenarios**:
1. **Model Creation**: APIKey model creates with proper encryption
2. **Encryption**: Values are encrypted in database, decrypted on retrieval
3. **CRUD Operations**: All operations work correctly with user isolation
4. **Security**: Cannot access other users' keys, encryption errors handled
5. **Validation**: Invalid formats rejected, duplicate names prevented

**Success Criteria**: All tests pass, encryption verified, no plain text storage

## Verification
- [x] APIKey model implemented with proper fields and relationships
- [x] Encryption/decryption working correctly with cryptography library
- [x] CRUD operations implemented and tested
- [x] User isolation enforced (users can only access their own keys)
- [x] Input validation prevents invalid API key storage
- [x] Database migration created and applied
- [x] No plain text API key values stored in database
