# [Task 1-3] Basic FastAPI Application with Health Check

## Description
Create a basic FastAPI application with proper structure, CORS configuration, and a health check endpoint. This serves as the foundation for all future API endpoints.

## Requirements
1. Basic FastAPI application instance
2. CORS middleware configuration for frontend integration
3. Health check endpoint at `/health`
4. Root endpoint at `/` with basic API info
5. Environment variable configuration support
6. Proper application metadata (title, description, version)
7. Uvicorn server configuration for development

## Implementation Plan
1. ✅ Create FastAPI app instance with metadata
2. ✅ Configure CORS middleware for frontend requests
3. ✅ Implement health check endpoint returning service status
4. ✅ Add root endpoint with basic API information
5. ✅ Configure environment variables for host, port, debug mode
6. ✅ Setup uvicorn server for development running

## Test Plan
**Objective**: Verify FastAPI application starts and health check endpoint responds correctly

**Test Scenarios**:
1. Application starts without errors
2. Health check endpoint returns proper JSON response
3. Root endpoint returns API information
4. CORS headers are properly configured

**Success Criteria**:
- FastAPI app starts on configured port
- `/health` returns `{"status": "healthy", "service": "crewai-backend", "version": "1.0.0"}`
- `/` returns basic API information
- CORS allows frontend requests from localhost:3000

## Verification
**Implementation Status**: ✅ Complete

**Files Created/Modified**:
- `backend/main.py` - FastAPI application with health check endpoint

**Verification Steps**:
1. ✅ FastAPI app configured with proper metadata
2. ✅ CORS middleware allows frontend integration
3. ✅ Health check endpoint implemented at `/health`
4. ✅ Root endpoint provides API information
5. ✅ Environment variables supported for configuration
6. ✅ Uvicorn server configuration for development

## Files Modified
- `backend/main.py` - Main FastAPI application file

## Notes
- Health check endpoint follows standard format for monitoring
- CORS configured for localhost:3000 (React frontend default)
- Environment variables allow flexible deployment configuration
- Uvicorn configured for development with hot reload
