# [1-29] Streaming Performance Testing

**Parent PBI**: [PBI-001: CrewAI Backend API Development](mdc:tasks.md)

## Description

## Requirements

1. **Load Testing Framework**
   - Automated test scripts for concurrent connections
   - Configurable test parameters (clients, duration, message frequency)
   - Resource monitoring during tests

2. **Performance Metrics**
   - Connection establishment time
   - Message latency (send to receive)
   - Throughput (messages per second)
   - Memory usage per connection
   - CPU utilization under load

3. **Test Scenarios**
   - Single client continuous streaming
   - Multiple clients (10, 50, 100, 200) concurrent connections
   - High-frequency message bursts
   - Long-duration stability tests
   - Client disconnect/reconnect scenarios

4. **Reporting**
   - Performance benchmarks and thresholds
   - Resource usage graphs and analysis
   - Scalability recommendations

## Implementation Plan

1. **Test Infrastructure**
   - Create performance test suite using pytest and asyncio
   - Implement client simulators for both SSE and WebSocket
   - Setup monitoring for system resources

2. **Test Implementation**
   - Connection load tests
   - Message throughput tests
   - Stability and endurance tests
   - Resource leak detection

3. **Monitoring Integration**
   - Memory profiling during tests
   - CPU usage tracking
   - Network bandwidth monitoring

## Test Plan

**Simple Integration Test**: Performance test framework runs and produces basic metrics

**Performance Test Objectives**:
- Establish baseline performance metrics for current SSE implementation
- Test scalability limits with increasing concurrent connections
- Identify bottlenecks and resource constraints
- Validate system stability under sustained load

**Test Matrix**:
- Connection counts: 1, 10, 50, 100, 200 clients
- Message frequencies: 1/sec, 10/sec, 100/sec
- Test duration: 30 seconds, 5 minutes, 30 minutes
- Both SSE and WebSocket implementations

**Success Criteria**:
- Performance tests run without errors
- Clear metrics and benchmarks established
- System remains stable under expected production load
- Resource usage stays within acceptable limits

## Verification

- [ ] Performance test framework implemented
- [ ] Load tests completed for various client counts
- [ ] Latency and throughput metrics collected
- [ ] Resource usage monitoring working
- [ ] Performance report with recommendations generated
- [ ] Stability tests pass for extended duration
