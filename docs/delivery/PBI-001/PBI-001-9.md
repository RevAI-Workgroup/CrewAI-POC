# [1-9] Message Model

**Parent Task List**: [Tasks for PBI-001](mdc:tasks.md)

## Description
Create Message model with execution linking to support chat functionality and trigger crew executions. The model should handle user messages, system responses, and link to execution logs.

## Status History

- **2024-12-30 20:45**: User approved task (Proposed → Agreed)
- **2024-12-30 20:45**: Started implementation (Agreed → InProgress)
- **2024-12-30 20:50**: Implementation completed (InProgress → Done)

## Requirements
1. Create Message model with SQLAlchemy
2. Support user messages and system responses  
3. Link messages to threads and executions
4. Include metadata for message types and timestamps
5. Support message status tracking
6. Add relationship to execution logs

## Implementation Plan
1. Define Message model in `backend/models/message.py`
2. Add relationships to Thread and Execution models
3. Create message type enums (user, assistant, system)
4. Add database migration
5. Create basic CRUD operations
6. Add to main model imports

## Test Plan
**Objectives**: Verify Message model creation, relationships, and basic operations
**Scope**: Unit tests for model validation and database operations
**Environment**: Test database with existing Thread and User models
**Key Scenarios**:
- Message creation with valid thread reference
- Message-thread relationship validation
- Message-execution linking
- Message type validation
- Timestamp handling
**Success Criteria**: All tests pass, model integrates properly with existing schema

## Verification
- [x] Message model created with proper fields
- [x] Database relationships established
- [x] Message types properly defined
- [x] Migration runs successfully
- [x] Unit tests pass
- [x] Integration with existing models works
