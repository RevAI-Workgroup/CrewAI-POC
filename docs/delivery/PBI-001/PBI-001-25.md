# [1-25] SSE Implementation

## Description
Implement Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time streaming of execution status and updates to frontend clients. This provides a lightweight, unidirectional communication channel from server to client for live updates during crew execution.

## Requirements
1. **SSE Endpoint**: FastAPI endpoint for client SSE connections
2. **Event Broadcasting**: Service to broadcast events to connected clients
3. **Event Types**: Define event schemas for different update types
4. **Connection Management**: Handle client connections and disconnections
5. **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of connection errors
6. **Authentication**: Secure SSE endpoints with JWT validation

## Implementation Plan
1. Create SSE service for connection management
2. Implement FastAPI SSE endpoint with authentication
3. Define event schemas for execution updates
4. Add broadcasting capability to execution services
5. Handle connection lifecycle (connect/disconnect/error)
6. Add proper CORS headers for frontend integration

## Test Plan
### Objectives
- Verify SSE endpoint connectivity and authentication
- Test event broadcasting to connected clients
- Validate event schema and data integrity
- Test connection handling and error scenarios

### Test Scenarios
1. **Connection Tests**
   - Client connects to SSE endpoint
   - Authentication validation
   - Multiple client connections
   - Connection timeout handling

2. **Event Broadcasting**
   - Broadcast execution status events
   - Multiple event types
   - Client receives correct events
   - Event ordering and timing

3. **Error Handling**
   - Invalid authentication
   - Network disconnections
   - Server restart scenarios
   - Malformed event data

### Success Criteria
- SSE endpoint accepts authenticated connections
- Events broadcast correctly to all connected clients
- Proper error handling and graceful disconnection
- Compatible with frontend integration

## Verification
- [x] SSE endpoint responds with proper headers
- [x] Client can establish SSE connection
- [x] Events broadcast to connected clients
- [x] Authentication properly validated
- [x] Error handling working correctly
- [x] All tests passing
