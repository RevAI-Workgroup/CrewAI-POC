# [1-22] Execution Status Management

**Parent PBI**: [PBI-001: CrewAI Backend API Development](mdc:prd.md)  
**Task Index**: [Tasks for PBI-001](mdc:tasks.md)

## Description

Implement comprehensive status management for execution tracking including status transitions, progress updates, and execution lifecycle management. Build upon the async execution service to provide detailed status tracking and management capabilities.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Enhanced execution status tracking with detailed state transitions
- Progress tracking with percentage and step information
- Execution timing and duration calculations
- Status validation and transition rules
- Bulk status operations for multiple executions
- Status history and audit trail

### Technical Requirements
- Extend existing Execution model with advanced status methods
- Create execution status service for centralized management
- Add status validation and business rules
- Support for status callbacks and notifications
- Integration with async execution service
- Database transaction safety for status updates

### Dependencies
- Task 1-21: Async Execution Service (Done)
- Task 1-10: Execution Log Model (Done)
- Existing Execution model in database

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Enhanced Status Management Service
- Create ExecutionStatusService for centralized status operations
- Implement status transition validation
- Add bulk status operations
- Progress tracking with detailed step information

### Step 2: Status Transition Rules
- Define valid status transitions
- Implement transition validation
- Add status change callbacks
- Error handling for invalid transitions

### Step 3: Enhanced Model Methods
- Extend Execution model with advanced status methods
- Add calculated properties for duration and performance
- Implement status history tracking
- Progress update methods with validation

### Step 4: Integration with Async Service
- Update async execution service to use enhanced status tracking
- Add progress callbacks during execution
- Implement status notifications
- Error status management

## Test Plan

### Unit Tests
- Status transition validation
- Progress tracking accuracy
- Duration calculations
- Bulk operations
- Error handling for invalid states

### Integration Tests
- Status updates during actual execution
- Database transaction safety
- Async service integration
- Status callback functionality

## Verification

### Success Criteria
- All status transitions follow business rules
- Progress tracking is accurate and real-time
- Duration calculations are correct
- Bulk operations perform efficiently
- Integration with async service is seamless

### Test Coverage
- Unit tests: >90% coverage
- All status transition paths tested
- Error conditions handled properly
- Performance meets requirements
