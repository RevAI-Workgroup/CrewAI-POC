# [1-20] Graph to CrewAI Translation

## Description
Create a service to convert graph data stored in the graph_data JSON field to CrewAI objects (Crew, Agent, Task). This translation layer enables execution of visual graphs as functional CrewAI crews.

**Parent Task Index**: [Tasks for PBI-001](mdc:../tasks.md)

## Status History
- **2024-12-30 10:00:00**: Created task (Status: Proposed)
- **2024-12-30 10:15:00**: User approved task (Status: Proposed → Agreed) 
- **2024-12-30 10:30:00**: Started implementation (Status: Agreed → InProgress)
- **2024-12-30 11:00:00**: Completed implementation (Status: InProgress → Done)

## Requirements
1. Service to extract nodes and edges from graph_data JSON field
2. Translation of agent nodes to CrewAI Agent objects
3. Translation of task nodes to CrewAI Task objects  
4. Translation of crew nodes to CrewAI Crew objects
5. Handle tool assignments and dependencies
6. Validate graph structure before translation
7. Error handling for invalid graph configurations
8. Support for both sequential and hierarchical processes

## Implementation Plan
1. **Graph Data Parser**: Extract nodes/edges from graph_data JSON
2. **Agent Translator**: Convert agent nodes to CrewAI Agent instances
3. **Task Translator**: Convert task nodes to CrewAI Task instances  
4. **Crew Translator**: Convert crew nodes to CrewAI Crew instances
5. **Dependency Handler**: Resolve task dependencies and context
6. **Translation Service**: Main service orchestrating all translations
7. **Validation**: Pre-translation validation of graph structure

## Test Plan
**Objectives**: Verify accurate translation from graph data to CrewAI objects

**Scope**:
- Graph data parsing and validation
- Node-to-object translation accuracy
- Dependency resolution
- Error handling for invalid configurations

**Key Scenarios**:
1. Simple graph with 1 agent, 1 task → CrewAI Crew
2. Complex graph with multiple agents/tasks → CrewAI Crew
3. Invalid graph data → proper error handling
4. Missing required fields → validation errors
5. Hierarchical process translation

**Success Criteria**:
- Graph data correctly parsed from JSON field
- All node types properly translated
- Dependencies correctly established
- Invalid graphs properly rejected

## Verification

- [x] Agent translation working
- [x] Task translation working  
- [x] Crew translation working
- [x] Dependency resolution implemented
- [x] Error handling comprehensive
- [x] Unit tests created
