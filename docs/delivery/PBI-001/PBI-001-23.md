# [1-23] Execution Error Handling

**Parent PBI**: [PBI-001: CrewAI Backend API Development](mdc:prd.md)  
**Task Index**: [Tasks for PBI-001](mdc:tasks.md)

## Description

Implement comprehensive error handling for CrewAI crew execution including retry logic, error classification, failure recovery, and detailed error reporting. Enhance the existing async execution service with robust error management capabilities.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Comprehensive error classification and categorization
- Retry logic with exponential backoff and configurable limits
- Error recovery strategies for different failure types
- Detailed error reporting with stack traces and context
- Circuit breaker pattern for external service failures
- Error notification and alerting system

### Technical Requirements
- Create error handling service for centralized error management
- Extend execution model with detailed error tracking
- Implement retry strategies with configurable parameters
- Add error metrics and monitoring integration
- Database transaction safety during error scenarios
- Integration with existing logging and monitoring systems

### Dependencies
- Task 1-21: Async Execution Service (Done)
- Task 1-22: Execution Status Management (In Progress)
- Task 1-10: Execution Log Model (Done)
- Existing logging infrastructure

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Error Classification System
- Define error types and categories (network, validation, resource, etc.)
- Create error hierarchy with inheritance
- Implement error code system for API responses
- Add error severity levels

### Step 2: Enhanced Retry Logic
- Implement exponential backoff with jitter
- Configure retry limits per error type
- Add circuit breaker for external services
- Dead letter queue for permanently failed tasks

### Step 3: Error Recovery Strategies
- Automatic recovery for transient errors
- Partial execution recovery where possible
- Graceful degradation for non-critical failures
- Error context preservation across retries

### Step 4: Error Monitoring and Reporting
- Detailed error logging with structured data
- Error metrics collection for monitoring
- Error aggregation and trending
- Alert integration for critical failures

## Test Plan

### Unit Tests
- Error classification accuracy
- Retry logic with different error types
- Circuit breaker functionality
- Error recovery scenarios
- Database rollback on failures

### Integration Tests
- End-to-end error handling during execution
- Error persistence and retrieval
- Monitoring integration
- Alert system functionality

### Error Simulation Tests
- Network failure scenarios
- Resource exhaustion simulation
- Invalid input handling
- External service failures

## Verification

### Success Criteria
- All error types are properly classified and handled
- Retry logic reduces transient failure impact
- Error recovery maintains system stability
- Error reporting provides actionable information
- Monitoring accurately tracks error patterns

### Test Coverage
- Unit tests: >95% coverage for error paths
- All error scenarios tested
- Recovery mechanisms validated
- Performance impact minimized
