# [Task 1-5] User Registration and Login

## Description
Create user registration and login endpoints with pseudo/passphrase authentication flow. This integrates the User model and authentication utilities from Task 1-4 to provide working user management endpoints with passphrase-only login.

## Requirements
1. âœ… User registration endpoint with pseudo input and passphrase generation
2. âœ… User login endpoint using only passphrase with JWT token response
3. âœ… Complete database integration for auth dependencies
4. âœ… Token refresh endpoint for session management
5. âœ… Registration returns generated passphrase to user
6. ðŸ”„ User profile endpoints (reserved for future task)
7. âœ… Proper error handling and validation
8. âœ… Integration with existing User model and auth utilities
9. âœ… Simplified authentication flow without profile fields

## Implementation Plan
1. âœ… Complete database integration in dependencies.py
2. âœ… Create authentication router with endpoints
3. âœ… Implement user registration endpoint (pseudo input, generate unique passphrase)
4. âœ… Implement user login endpoint (passphrase-only authentication)
5. âœ… Add token refresh functionality
6. ðŸ”„ Create user profile management endpoints (reserved for future)
7. âœ… Integrate router with main FastAPI app
8. âœ… Test all endpoints with proper error handling

## Test Plan
**Objective**: Verify complete pseudo/passphrase authentication flow works end-to-end

**Test Scenarios**:
1. âœ… User registration with pseudo generates unique passphrase
2. âœ… Registration response includes generated passphrase
3. âœ… User login with passphrase-only authentication
4. âœ… JWT token validation and refresh
5. ðŸ”„ Profile retrieval and updates (future task)
6. âœ… Error handling for invalid passphrases
7. âœ… Database persistence verification
8. âœ… Passphrase uniqueness enforcement

**Success Criteria**:
- âœ… User can register with pseudo and receive unique passphrase
- âœ… Login works with passphrase-only (no pseudo required)
- âœ… Protected endpoints work with authentication
- âœ… Token refresh maintains sessions
- âœ… All endpoints return proper HTTP status codes
- âœ… Passphrase format is `word-word-word-word-word-word`

## Verification
**Implementation Status**: âœ… Complete

**Core Features Delivered**:
1. **User Registration**: Complete endpoint with pseudo input and unique passphrase generation
2. **User Login**: Passphrase-only authentication with JWT token generation and tracking
3. **Token Refresh**: Session management with refresh token validation
4. **Database Integration**: Full SQLAlchemy integration with User model
5. **Router Integration**: FastAPI router included in main application
6. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error responses for invalid passphrases

**Files Created/Modified**:
- âœ… `backend/routers/auth.py` - Authentication router with registration (pseudoâ†’passphrase), login (passphrase-only), refresh endpoints
- âœ… `backend/utils/dependencies.py` - Complete database integration for passphrase auth
- âœ… `backend/main.py` - Router integration with FastAPI app

**API Endpoints Delivered**:
- `POST /auth/register` - User registration with pseudo, returns generated passphrase
- `POST /auth/login` - User authentication with passphrase-only, returns JWT tokens
- `POST /auth/refresh` - Token refresh for session management

## Files Modified
- `backend/routers/auth.py` - Authentication router implementation for pseudo/passphrase system
- `backend/utils/dependencies.py` - Database integration for passphrase auth dependencies
- `backend/main.py` - Added auth router to main application

## Notes
- Core pseudo/passphrase authentication flow is complete and functional
- Registration generates unique passphrase in format: `word-word-word-word-word-word`
- Login requires only passphrase (pseudo not needed for authentication)
- User profile management endpoints reserved for future task (cleaner separation)
- SQLAlchemy type hints can be refined in future optimization tasks
- Database tables created successfully for User model with pseudo/passphrase fields
- All JWT utilities from Task 1-4 fully integrated and working
