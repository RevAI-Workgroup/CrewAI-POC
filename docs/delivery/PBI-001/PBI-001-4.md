# [Task 1-4] Authentication Models

## Description
Implement User model with secure password handling and JWT token management system. This provides the foundation for user authentication throughout the API.

## Requirements
1. ✅ User model with email, password hash, and profile fields
2. ✅ Secure password hashing using bcrypt
3. ✅ JWT token generation and validation utilities
4. ✅ User authentication schema models
5. ✅ Password reset token handling
6. ✅ API key association with users (prepared for future)
7. ✅ Role-based access control foundation

## Implementation Plan
1. ✅ Create User SQLAlchemy model with authentication fields
2. ✅ Implement password hashing and verification utilities
3. ✅ Create JWT token generation and validation functions
4. ✅ Define Pydantic schemas for user authentication
5. ✅ Add user role enumeration for future access control
6. ✅ Create password reset token model
7. ✅ Setup authentication dependency injection

## Test Plan
**Objective**: Verify User model creation, password hashing, and JWT token functionality

**Test Scenarios**:
1. User model creates and stores correctly in database
2. Passwords are properly hashed and verified
3. JWT tokens are generated and validated correctly
4. User schemas serialize/deserialize properly
5. Authentication dependencies work correctly

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ User can be created with hashed password
- ✅ Password verification works with bcrypt
- ✅ JWT tokens contain correct claims and can be decoded
- ✅ Pydantic schemas validate user data properly
- ✅ Authentication utilities are ready for endpoint use

## Verification
**Implementation Status**: ✅ Complete

**Files Created/Modified**:
- ✅ `backend/models/user.py` - User model with authentication fields and methods
- ✅ `backend/utils/auth.py` - JWT token utilities and password hashing
- ✅ `backend/schemas/auth.py` - Pydantic schemas for authentication
- ✅ `backend/utils/dependencies.py` - FastAPI authentication dependencies
- ✅ `backend/schemas/__init__.py` - Schema package initialization
- ✅ `backend/models/__init__.py` - Updated with User model exports

**Key Features Implemented**:
1. **User Model**: Complete authentication model with roles, password reset, profile fields
2. **Security**: Bcrypt password hashing with secure token generation
3. **JWT Management**: Access/refresh token creation and validation
4. **Schemas**: Comprehensive Pydantic models for all auth operations
5. **Dependencies**: FastAPI auth dependencies for protected routes
6. **Role System**: Admin/User roles with permission checking

## Files Modified
- `backend/models/user.py` - User authentication model
- `backend/utils/auth.py` - Authentication utilities
- `backend/schemas/auth.py` - Authentication schemas
- `backend/utils/dependencies.py` - Authentication dependencies
- `backend/schemas/__init__.py` - Schema package
- `backend/models/__init__.py` - Model exports

## Notes
- User model includes soft delete and audit fields via BaseModel inheritance
- Password hashing uses bcrypt with configurable rounds
- JWT tokens support both access and refresh token types
- Role-based access control ready for future endpoint protection
- Password reset tokens use cryptographically secure random generation
- Dependencies framework prepared for integration with FastAPI routes
