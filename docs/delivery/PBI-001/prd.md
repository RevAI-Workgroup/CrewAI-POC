# PBI-001: CrewAI Backend API Development

**Parent**: [Product Backlog](mdc:../backlog.md)

## Overview
Complete backend API development for CrewAI Graph Builder application, providing authentication, graph management, CrewAI execution, and real-time streaming capabilities.

## Problem Statement
The frontend React application requires a robust backend API to enable users to visually create and execute CrewAI crews. The backend must handle complex graph validation, async crew execution, and real-time status updates.

## User Stories
- As a frontend developer, I need JWT authentication and user management
- As a frontend developer, I need CRUD operations for graphs and thread
- As a frontend developer, I need graph validation that ensures CrewAI compatibility
- As a frontend developer, I need async CrewAI execution with queueing
- As a frontend developer, I need real-time streaming of execution updates
- As a frontend developer, I need integrated tool repository access
- As a frontend developer, I need MLFlow metrics integration

## Technical Approach
- **Framework**: FastAPI with async support
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy ORM
- **Authentication**: JWT + API key system
- **Queue**: Celery with Redis
- **Streaming**: Server-Sent Events (SSE)
- **ML Monitoring**: MLFlow integration
- **CrewAI Version**: 0.121.1

## UX/UI Considerations
- API responses follow RESTful conventions
- Comprehensive error messages with proper HTTP status codes
- Real-time feedback through SSE streaming
- Async processing prevents UI blocking

## Acceptance Criteria
1. JWT + API key authentication system with user management
2. PostgreSQL database with all required models and relationships
3. CRUD operations for graphs, threads, messages, and API keys
4. Graph validation service that ensures CrewAI compatibility
5. CrewAI execution service with async processing and queueing
6. SSE streaming for real-time execution updates
7. Integrated tool repository with hello world tool
8. MLFlow integration for metrics collection
9. Admin-only template management
10. Comprehensive error handling and logging
11. Docker support with docker-compose for development
12. Complete API documentation and testing suite

## Dependencies
- Frontend React application (existing)
- External packages: FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, CrewAI 0.121.1, Celery, Redis, MLFlow

## Open Questions
- Specific CrewAI tool requirements beyond hello world tool?
- MLFlow deployment preferences?
- Specific security requirements for API keys?
