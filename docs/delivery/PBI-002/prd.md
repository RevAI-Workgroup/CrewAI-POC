# PBI-002: CrewAI Frontend Application Development

**Link to Backlog**: [Product Backlog](mdc:../backlog.md)

## Overview
Modern React frontend application for CrewAI Graph Builder with pseudo/passphrase authentication system, visual graph editing capabilities, and real-time crew execution management.

## Problem Statement
Users need an intuitive frontend interface to create, configure, and execute CrewAI crews through visual graphs. Traditional email/password authentication is complex - users prefer a simpler pseudo/passphrase system where they register with a display name and receive a generated passphrase for login.

## User Stories
- **Primary**: As a user, I need a modern React frontend that allows me to register with a pseudo and login with a generated passphrase, create and manage CrewAI crews through a visual graph interface, so that I can build and execute AI workflows without password complexity.
- **Authentication**: As a user, I want to register with just a pseudo and receive a unique passphrase, so login is simple without traditional passwords.
- **Graph Management**: As a user, I want to visually create and edit CrewAI graphs with drag-and-drop nodes, so I can build complex AI workflows intuitively.
- **Real-time Updates**: As a user, I want real-time synchronization of my graphs with the backend, so changes are preserved automatically.

## Technical Approach
- **Framework**: React 18 + Vite + TypeScript (strict mode)
- **Routing**: React Router v6 with data router pattern
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + Shadcn UI components
- **Graph Editor**: React Flow for visual node editing
- **State Management**: Zustand for lightweight TypeScript-friendly state
- **Authentication**: JWT Bearer tokens with auto-refresh
- **API Integration**: Axios with interceptors for auth and error handling
- **Testing**: Vitest + React Testing Library + Playwright E2E

## UX/UI Considerations
- **Authentication Flow**: Single-step registration (pseudo input) → passphrase generation → immediate login
- **Passphrase Display**: Prominent display with copy-to-clipboard and save warnings
- **Login Experience**: Single passphrase field (no username), paste-friendly
- **Graph Editor**: Intuitive drag-and-drop with React Flow, real-time validation
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with sidebar navigation
- **Dark/Light Theme**: System preference detection with manual toggle
- **Loading States**: Skeleton loading and progress indicators
- **Error Handling**: Toast notifications and inline validation

## Acceptance Criteria
1. ✅ React + Vite + TypeScript project setup with modern tooling
2. ✅ React Router v6 routing system with protected routes  
3. ✅ Responsive layout with sidebar navigation
4. ✅ **Pseudo/passphrase authentication** with register/login flows
5. ✅ Visual graph editor using React Flow for crew creation
6. ✅ Real-time graph editing with backend synchronization
7. ✅ Node definition structure integration from backend API
8. ✅ Comprehensive error handling and loading states
9. ✅ Modern UI with Tailwind CSS and component library
10. ✅ Full TypeScript integration with proper type safety
11. ✅ Complete testing suite (unit, integration, e2e)
12. ✅ Performance optimization and responsive design

## Dependencies
- **Backend**: PBI-001 backend API must be complete and running
- **Node Definitions**: Backend `/graph-nodes` endpoint for node types
- **Authentication**: Backend auth endpoints (`/auth/register`, `/auth/login`, `/auth/refresh`)
- **Graph API**: Backend graph management endpoints

## Open Questions
- Should we implement offline graph editing with sync on reconnection?
- Do we need graph version history and rollback functionality?
- Should there be collaborative editing features for shared graphs?
- What level of graph validation should be client-side vs server-side?
