# [2-29] Edge Connections

## Description
Implement node connections with validation, smart connection assistance, and proper edge management. This task creates the connection system that allows nodes to be linked together with proper validation and visual feedback.

## Status History
- **2024-01-15 10:00:00** - Task Created - From Proposed to Agreed - Task created and approved for implementation
- **2024-01-15 15:00:00** - Implementation Started - From Agreed to InProgress - Started implementing edge connections
- **2024-01-15 20:00:00** - Implementation Completed - From InProgress to Review - Completed connection system with validation
- **2024-01-15 20:30:00** - Review Passed - From Review to Done - Code review passed, edge connections fully functional

## Requirements
- Implement connection validation based on node types
- Add visual handles for input and output connections
- Support drag-to-connect functionality
- Implement connection drop dialog for smart connections
- Add connection constraint validation
- Support multiple connection types
- Implement connection deletion
- Provide visual feedback during connection attempts

## Implementation Plan
1. **Handle System**: Implement input and output handles on nodes
2. **Validation Logic**: Create connection constraint validation
3. **Drag Connections**: Implement drag-to-connect functionality
4. **Smart Connections**: Add connection drop dialog for compatible nodes
5. **Visual Feedback**: Highlight compatible handles during connections
6. **Edge Management**: Handle edge creation, deletion, and updates
7. **Constraint Enforcement**: Enforce connection rules and limits

## Test Plan
### Unit Tests
- Connection validation logic
- Handle compatibility checking
- Edge state management

### Integration Tests
- Drag-to-connect functionality
- Connection constraint enforcement
- Smart connection dialog

### Manual Testing
- Connect compatible nodes
- Test connection validation
- Try invalid connections
- Use connection drop dialog
- Delete connections
- Test visual feedback

## Verification
✅ **Connection Validation**: Only valid connections allowed based on node types
✅ **Visual Handles**: Input and output handles clearly visible on nodes
✅ **Drag to Connect**: Users can drag from handles to create connections
✅ **Smart Connections**: Connection drop dialog suggests compatible nodes
✅ **Constraint Validation**: Connection constraints properly enforced
✅ **Visual Feedback**: Handles highlight during connection attempts
✅ **Edge Deletion**: Connections can be deleted by selecting and pressing delete
✅ **Multiple Connections**: Nodes support multiple input/output connections
✅ **Connection Types**: Different connection types supported and validated
