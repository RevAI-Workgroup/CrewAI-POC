# [Task 2-19] Graph Store and CRUD Operations

## Description
Create a Zustand store for graph management that handles CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for graphs. The store should integrate with the backend API and provide state management for graph operations throughout the application.

## Status History
- **2024-12-19 16:00** - Proposed → Agreed (User approved via direct instruction)
- **2024-12-19 16:00** - Agreed → InProgress (Starting implementation)
- **2024-12-19 16:30** - InProgress → Done (Implementation completed)

## Requirements
1. Create `graphStore.ts` using Zustand with TypeScript support
2. Implement CRUD operations for graphs:
   - `createGraph()` - POST to `/api/graphs` with empty body, using access_token
   - `fetchGraphs()` - GET from `/api/graphs` 
   - `updateGraph(id, data)` - PUT to `/api/graphs/{id}`
   - `deleteGraph(id)` - DELETE to `/api/graphs/{id}`
3. State management for:
   - Current graphs list
   - Selected graph
   - Loading states (isLoading, isCreating, isDeleting)
   - Error handling
4. Use access_token from auth store for API authentication
5. Follow the same pattern as authStore.ts for consistency
6. Export store and individual action functions
7. Create TypeScript types for Graph entities

## Implementation Plan
1. Create `types/graph.types.ts` for Graph interfaces
2. Add graph API routes to `config/api.ts` 
3. Create `stores/graphStore.ts` with Zustand store
4. Update `stores/index.ts` to export graph store
5. Create `pages/GraphsPage.tsx` as a grid view component
6. Update routing to remove `/graph/new` route (no longer needed)

## Test Plan
- **Unit Tests**: Store actions and state management
- **Integration Tests**: API integration with mock responses
- **Manual Testing**: Graph CRUD operations via UI

## Verification
- [x] Graph store created with CRUD operations
- [x] TypeScript types defined for graphs
- [x] API integration working with authentication
- [x] Graph grid page component created
- [x] No /graph/new route (POST with empty body instead)
- [x] Loading and error states handled
- [x] Exports available for use in components

## Files Modified
- `src/types/graph.types.ts` (new)
- `src/stores/graphStore.ts` (new)
- `src/stores/index.ts` (updated)
- `src/config/api.ts` (updated)
- `src/pages/GraphsPage.tsx` (new)
- `src/router/index.tsx` (updated)
- `src/pages/Graphs.tsx` (updated with full grid functionality)

## Notes
- Graph types and API routes were already defined in the codebase
- Implemented responsive grid layout with card components
- Added confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
- Included loading skeletons and empty states
- Follow Material Design patterns for better UX
