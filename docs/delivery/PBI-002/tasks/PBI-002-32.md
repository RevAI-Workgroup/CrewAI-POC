# [2-32] Field Visibility System

## Description
Implement dynamic field visibility based on selections and conditions to create adaptive forms that show relevant fields based on user choices. This task creates an intelligent form system that adapts to user selections.

## Status History
- **2024-01-15 10:00:00** - Task Created - From Proposed to Agreed - Task created and approved for implementation
- **2024-01-15 18:00:00** - Implementation Started - From Agreed to InProgress - Started implementing field visibility system
- **2024-01-15 23:00:00** - Implementation Completed - From InProgress to Review - Completed dynamic field visibility
- **2024-01-15 23:30:00** - Review Passed - From Review to Done - Code review passed, field visibility system fully functional

## Requirements
- Implement conditional field visibility based on other field values
- Support multiple condition types (equals, not equals, contains, etc.)
- Add field grouping and section visibility
- Handle complex visibility logic with multiple conditions
- Implement smooth transitions for field show/hide
- Support default visibility states from node definitions
- Add validation that respects field visibility
- Ensure proper form layout with dynamic fields

## Implementation Plan
1. **Condition Engine**: Create system to evaluate visibility conditions
2. **Field Monitoring**: Monitor field changes to trigger visibility updates
3. **Transition System**: Add smooth animations for field visibility changes
4. **Validation Integration**: Ensure validation respects field visibility
5. **Layout Management**: Handle form layout with dynamic field visibility
6. **Performance Optimization**: Optimize condition evaluation for performance
7. **Testing**: Comprehensive testing of visibility logic

## Test Plan
### Unit Tests
- Condition evaluation logic
- Field visibility state management
- Validation integration

### Integration Tests
- Field visibility with form interactions
- Complex condition scenarios
- Performance with many fields

### Manual Testing
- Test various condition types
- Verify smooth transitions
- Check complex visibility scenarios
- Test form validation with hidden fields
- Verify layout stability

## Verification
✅ **Conditional Visibility**: Fields show/hide based on other field values
✅ **Multiple Conditions**: Support for complex visibility conditions
✅ **Smooth Transitions**: Animated transitions for field visibility changes
✅ **Validation Integration**: Hidden fields excluded from validation
✅ **Layout Stability**: Form layout remains stable during visibility changes
✅ **Performance**: Fast condition evaluation without lag
✅ **Default States**: Proper default visibility from node definitions
✅ **Complex Logic**: Support for AND/OR condition combinations
✅ **Field Grouping**: Section-level visibility control
