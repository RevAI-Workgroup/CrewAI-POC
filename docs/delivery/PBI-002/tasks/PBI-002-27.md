# [2-27] Basic Node Types

## Description
Implement Crew, Agent, Task, and LLM node types with their specific properties, validation rules, and visual representations. This task creates the core node types that form the foundation of CrewAI workflows.

## Status History
- **2024-01-15 10:00:00** - Task Created - From Proposed to Agreed - Task created and approved for implementation
- **2024-01-15 13:00:00** - Implementation Started - From Agreed to InProgress - Started implementing core node types
- **2024-01-15 18:00:00** - Implementation Completed - From InProgress to Review - Completed all basic node types
- **2024-01-15 18:30:00** - Review Passed - From Review to Done - Code review passed, all node types working correctly

## Requirements
- Implement Crew node type with team management properties
- Create Agent node type with role and goal definitions
- Develop Task node type with execution parameters
- Add LLM node types (OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, etc.)
- Define proper field types and validation for each node
- Implement visual styling and icons for each type
- Add connection constraints between node types
- Support dynamic field visibility based on selections

## Implementation Plan
1. **Node Type Definitions**: Define schemas for each basic node type
2. **Field Specifications**: Create field definitions with proper types and validation
3. **Visual Design**: Implement icons and styling for each node type
4. **Connection Rules**: Define which nodes can connect to which
5. **Validation Logic**: Implement type-specific validation rules
6. **Dynamic Forms**: Create adaptive forms based on node type
7. **Testing**: Comprehensive testing of all node types

## Test Plan
### Unit Tests
- Node type validation logic
- Field type checking
- Connection constraint validation

### Integration Tests
- Node creation and editing
- Inter-node connections
- Form field behavior

### Manual Testing
- Create each node type
- Edit node properties
- Test connections between nodes
- Validate field constraints
- Check visual representation

## Verification
✅ **Crew Nodes**: Crew nodes with team management properties implemented
✅ **Agent Nodes**: Agent nodes with role, goal, and backstory fields
✅ **Task Nodes**: Task nodes with description, expected output, and tools
✅ **LLM Nodes**: Multiple LLM provider nodes (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
✅ **Field Types**: Proper field types (text, select, boolean, etc.) for each node
✅ **Validation**: Type-specific validation rules enforced
✅ **Visual Design**: Distinct icons and styling for each node type
✅ **Connection Rules**: Proper connection constraints between node types
✅ **Dynamic Forms**: Forms adapt based on node type and field visibility
