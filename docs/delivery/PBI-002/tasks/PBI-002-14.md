### **Navigation Structure**
```typescript
const data = {
  navMain: [
    {
      title: "Dashboard",
      url: ROUTES.DASHBOARD,
      icon: Home,
      isActive: location.pathname === ROUTES.DASHBOARD,
      items: [],
    },
    {
      title: "Graphs",
      url: ROUTES.GRAPHS,
      icon: Network,
      isActive: location.pathname.startsWith('/graphs'),
      items: [
        {
          title: "All Graphs",
          url: ROUTES.GRAPHS,
          isActive: location.pathname === ROUTES.GRAPHS,
        },
        {
          title: "Create New",
          url: ROUTES.GRAPH_NEW,
          icon: Plus,
          isActive: location.pathname === ROUTES.GRAPH_NEW,
        },
      ],
    },
  ],
}
```
