# [2-21] Graph Creation and Editing

## Description
Create graph forms for metadata management including graph name, description, and basic settings. This task implements the UI components and functionality for creating new graphs and editing existing graph metadata.

## Status History
- **2024-01-15 10:00:00** - Task Created - From Proposed to Agreed - Task created and approved for implementation
- **2024-01-15 14:30:00** - Implementation Started - From Agreed to InProgress - Started implementing graph creation and editing forms
- **2024-01-15 18:45:00** - Implementation Completed - From InProgress to Review - Completed implementation with full CRUD operations
- **2024-01-15 19:15:00** - Review Passed - From Review to Done - Code review passed, all functionality working as expected

## Requirements
- Create graph creation form with name and description fields
- Implement graph editing functionality for metadata updates
- Add validation for required fields
- Integrate with graph store for state management
- Connect to backend API for persistence
- Handle loading states and error scenarios
- Support duplicate graph functionality

## Implementation Plan
1. **Graph Store Integration**: Implement CRUD operations in Zustand store
2. **API Integration**: Connect to backend endpoints for graph operations
3. **Form Components**: Create reusable form components for graph metadata
4. **Validation**: Add form validation and error handling
5. **UI Components**: Implement graph cards and action buttons
6. **State Management**: Handle loading states and optimistic updates

## Test Plan
### Unit Tests
- Graph store CRUD operations
- Form validation logic
- Component rendering with different states

### Integration Tests
- API integration for graph operations
- Form submission and data persistence
- Error handling scenarios

### Manual Testing
- Create new graph with valid data
- Edit existing graph metadata
- Duplicate graph functionality
- Validation error handling
- Loading state behavior

## Verification
✅ **Graph Creation**: Users can create new graphs with name and description
✅ **Graph Editing**: Users can edit existing graph metadata
✅ **Form Validation**: Required fields are validated with appropriate error messages
✅ **API Integration**: All operations properly integrated with backend API
✅ **State Management**: Graph store properly manages CRUD operations
✅ **Error Handling**: Proper error handling and user feedback
✅ **Duplicate Functionality**: Users can duplicate existing graphs
✅ **Loading States**: Appropriate loading indicators during operations
