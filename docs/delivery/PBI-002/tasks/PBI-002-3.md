# [2-3] React Router v6 Setup

**Parent Tasks**: [Tasks for PBI-002](mdc:tasks.md)  
**Parent PBI**: [PBI-002: CrewAI Frontend Application Development](mdc:prd.md)

## Description
Configure React Router v6 with data router pattern and basic routing structure for the CrewAI frontend application. This includes protected routes, authentication flow, and main application routing.

## Status History
- 2024-12-27 12:35 UTC - create_task - Status: Proposed - User: Task creation for React Router v6 setup
- 2024-12-27 12:36 UTC - user_approves - Status: Agreed - User: Approved for implementation
- 2024-12-27 12:37 UTC - start_work - Status: InProgress - User: Beginning React Router v6 implementation
- 2024-12-27 12:45 UTC - approve - Status: Done - User: React Router v6 setup completed with data router pattern

## Requirements
1. **React Router v6**: Install react-router-dom v6 with data router pattern
2. **Route Structure**: Setup main application routes (/login, /register, /dashboard, /graphs)
3. **Protected Routes**: Implement route protection for authenticated areas
4. **Layout Routes**: Configure nested routing with layouts
5. **Navigation**: Setup programmatic navigation hooks
6. **Route Types**: Define TypeScript types for routes
7. **Error Boundaries**: Add route-level error handling
8. **Loader Functions**: Setup data loading for routes

## Implementation Plan
1. Install React Router v6 dependencies
2. Create router configuration with createBrowserRouter
3. Setup route definitions and path constants
4. Implement protected route wrapper component
5. Create layout components for nested routing
6. Setup authentication route guards
7. Add navigation hooks and utilities
8. Configure error boundaries for routes
9. Test routing functionality and navigation

## Test Plan
**Objectives**: Verify React Router v6 is properly configured with protected routes and navigation

**Test Scenarios**:
- ✅ Routes navigate correctly to defined paths
- ✅ Protected routes redirect unauthenticated users to login
- ✅ Authenticated users can access protected areas
- ✅ Route parameters and query strings work correctly
- ✅ Browser back/forward navigation functions properly
- ✅ Route error boundaries catch navigation errors

**Success Criteria**:
- All routes accessible and functional
- Route protection working correctly
- Clean navigation without errors
- Proper TypeScript typing for routes

## Verification
- [ ] React Router v6 installed and configured
- [ ] Route definitions working correctly
- [ ] Protected routes redirect unauthorized users
- [ ] Navigation between routes functional
- [ ] Layout routing with nested components
- [ ] Error boundaries handle route errors
- [ ] TypeScript types for routing implemented
