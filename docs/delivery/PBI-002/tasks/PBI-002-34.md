# [Task 2-34] Real-time Synchronization

## Description
Implement real-time synchronization of graph changes with the backend API, replacing localStorage-based persistence with debounced backend saves for React Flow nodes, edges, and node properties.

| 2024-12-28 | complete | InProgress | Done | Implemented debounced backend sync with graph hooks | User |

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. **Debounced Backend Sync**: Auto-save graph changes to backend with 1-2 second debounce
2. **Node Changes**: Sync node creation, deletion, position changes, and property updates
3. **Edge Changes**: Sync edge connections and disconnections
4. **Form Data**: Sync node form data changes instead of using localStorage
5. **Loading States**: Show saving indicators during sync operations
6. **Error Handling**: Handle sync failures gracefully with retry mechanism

### Technical Requirements
1. Use existing `updateGraph()` API call from graph store
2. Integrate with React Flow's `useNodesState` and `useEdgesState`
3. Replace localStorage persistence in CustomNode component
4. Add debounce utility for API calls (1-2 second delay)
5. Maintain current undo/redo compatibility

### Data Structure
Backend expects graph_data format:
```json
{
  "graph_data": {
    "nodes": [/* React Flow nodes array */],
    "edges": [/* React Flow edges array */],
    "metadata": {/* Additional graph metadata */}
  }
}
```

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Graph Sync Hook
1. Create `useGraphSync` hook in `frontend/src/hooks/`
2. Accept nodes, edges, and graphId parameters
3. Implement debounced save to backend API
4. Handle loading and error states

### Phase 2: FlowEditor Integration
1. Modify `FlowEditor.tsx` to use sync hook
2. Connect React Flow state changes to backend sync
3. Load initial nodes/edges from selected graph data
4. Remove localStorage dependencies

### Phase 3: Node Data Sync
1. Update `CustomNode.tsx` to use centralized sync
2. Remove individual localStorage saves for node form data
3. Integrate form data changes with graph sync

### Phase 4: Visual Feedback
1. Add saving indicators in editor UI
2. Show sync status (saving, saved, error)
3. Implement retry mechanisms for failed saves

## Test Plan

### Unit Tests
1. Test debounced sync functionality
2. Test graph data transformation
3. Test error handling and retry logic

### Integration Tests
1. Test React Flow state sync with backend
2. Test node property changes sync
3. Test edge connection sync
4. Test conflict resolution

### Manual Testing
1. Create nodes and verify backend persistence
2. Test rapid changes with debounce behavior
3. Test network failure scenarios
4. Verify data consistency across page refreshes

## Verification
- [ ] Graph changes auto-save to backend within 2 seconds
- [ ] Node positions persist after page refresh
- [ ] Node form data saves without localStorage
- [ ] Edge connections sync properly
- [ ] Loading indicators show during saves
- [ ] Error handling works for network failures
- [ ] No data loss during rapid editing
