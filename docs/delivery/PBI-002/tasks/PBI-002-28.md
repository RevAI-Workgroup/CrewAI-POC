## Description
Add and remove nodes in the graph canvas with proper state management, validation, and user feedback. This task implements the core functionality for manipulating nodes within the visual graph editor.

## Status History
- **2024-01-15 10:00:00** - Task Created - From Proposed to Agreed - Task created and approved for implementation
- **2024-01-15 14:00:00** - Implementation Started - From Agreed to InProgress - Started implementing node manipulation
- **2024-01-15 19:00:00** - Implementation Completed - From InProgress to Review - Completed node creation and deletion
- **2024-01-15 19:30:00** - Review Passed - From Review to Done - Code review passed, node manipulation fully functional

## Requirements
- Implement drag-and-drop node creation from sidebar
- Add context menu for node operations
- Support keyboard shortcuts for node operations
- Implement node deletion with confirmation
- Handle node selection and multi-selection
- Manage node state persistence
- Add undo/redo for node operations
- Provide visual feedback during operations

## Implementation Plan
1. **Drag and Drop**: Implement node creation via drag from sidebar
2. **Context Menus**: Add right-click context menus for node operations
3. **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Implement Delete key and other shortcuts
4. **Selection System**: Handle single and multi-node selection
5. **State Management**: Ensure proper state updates in React Flow
6. **Persistence**: Save node changes to localStorage and backend
7. **User Feedback**: Add visual indicators and confirmations

## Test Plan
### Unit Tests
- Node creation logic
- Node deletion validation
- State management functions

### Integration Tests
- Drag and drop functionality
- Context menu operations
- Keyboard shortcut handling

### Manual Testing
- Drag nodes from sidebar to canvas
- Delete nodes using various methods
- Test multi-selection operations
- Verify state persistence
- Check undo/redo functionality

## Verification
✅ **Drag and Drop Creation**: Nodes can be dragged from sidebar to canvas
✅ **Context Menu Deletion**: Right-click context menu with delete option
✅ **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Delete key removes selected nodes
✅ **Selection System**: Single and multi-node selection working
✅ **State Persistence**: Node changes saved to localStorage
✅ **Visual Feedback**: Loading states and confirmations provided
✅ **Undo/Redo**: Node operations can be undone and redone
✅ **Validation**: Proper validation before node deletion
✅ **Edge Cleanup**: Connected edges removed when nodes are deleted
