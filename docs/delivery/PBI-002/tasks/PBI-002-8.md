# Task 2-8: Registration Form with Deferred Authentication

## Description
Build registration form with pseudo input, passphrase display, and deferred authentication flow for the CrewAI Frontend application.

## Status: Done ✅

## Implementation Details

### Components Created
1. `RegistrationForm` (`frontend/src/components/auth/registration-form.tsx`)
   - Form with pseudo input validation (5+ characters)
   - **Deferred authentication flow** - doesn't auto-login
   - Passphrase display with copy functionality
   - Alert dialog requiring user confirmation to continue
   - Auth data storage only after user clicks "Continue"

2. `PassphraseDisplay` (`frontend/src/components/ui/passphrase-display.tsx`)
   - Colored word display for better readability
   - Copy to clipboard functionality
   - Visual feedback for copy action

### Features Implemented
- **Deferred Registration Flow**:
  - Registration API call returns passphrase + auth data
  - Auth data stored in component state (not cookies)
  - User must explicitly click "Continue" to complete registration
  - Only then are cookies set and user logged in

- **Enhanced Security**:
  - Single encrypted cookie (`revai_auth`) instead of multiple cookies
  - AES encryption with secret key
  - Auth data only stored after user confirmation

- **User Experience**:
  - Pseudo input validation (5+ characters)
  - Form validation using Zod
  - Loading states during registration
  - Clear passphrase display with copy functionality
  - Warning to save passphrase before continuing
  - Error handling for registration failures

### Technical Details
- Uses React Hook Form with Zod validation
- Implements Shadcn UI components
- **NEW**: Integrates with auth store's `register()` and `completeRegistration()`
- **NEW**: Stores auth data temporarily until user confirms
- **NEW**: Uses encrypted cookie storage via `setAuthCookie()`
- Handles API errors gracefully
- Provides user feedback for all actions

### Registration Flow
1. User enters pseudo → Form validates input
2. User clicks "Sign up" → API registration call
3. Server returns passphrase + auth tokens
4. **Auth data stored in component state** (not cookies yet)
5. Alert dialog shows passphrase with copy button
6. User saves passphrase and clicks "Continue"
7. **Auth data stored in encrypted cookie** + user logged in
8. User redirected to dashboard

### Testing
- Form validation works correctly
- Passphrase display is clear and readable
- Copy functionality works as expected
- **NEW**: Deferred authentication flow works correctly
- **NEW**: Encrypted cookie storage works properly
- Error messages are displayed appropriately
- Navigation works after registration completion
- Responsive design works on all screen sizes

## Dependencies
- React Hook Form
- Zod
- Shadcn UI
- Zustand (auth store)
- React Router
- **NEW**: CryptoJS (for encrypted cookies)

## Security Improvements
- **Single encrypted cookie** instead of 4 separate cookies
- **AES encryption** with configurable secret key
- **User confirmation required** before storing auth data
- **Deferred login** ensures user has saved passphrase

## Files Modified
- `frontend/src/components/auth/registration-form.tsx` - Main registration form
- `frontend/src/stores/authStore.ts` - Added `register()` and `completeRegistration()`
- `frontend/src/utils/cookies.ts` - Encrypted cookie utilities
- `frontend/src/types/auth.types.ts` - Auth data interfaces

## Notes
- **Breaking Change**: Registration no longer auto-logs in user
- Passphrase display uses color coding for better readability
- Alert dialog ensures user sees and saves passphrase before continuing
- Form includes proper validation and error handling
- UI is consistent with design system
- **Security**: Uses AES-256 encryption for cookie storage
