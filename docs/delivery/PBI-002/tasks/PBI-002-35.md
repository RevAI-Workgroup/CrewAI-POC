# [Task 2-35] Undo/Redo Functionality

## Description
Implement undo/redo functionality for graph editing operations using Zustand state management with a maximum of 20 history states, integrated with the real-time synchronization system.

## Status History
| Timestamp | Event | From Status | To Status | Details | User |
|-----------|-------|-------------|-----------|---------|------|
| 2024-12-28 | create_task | - | Proposed | Task created for undo/redo implementation | User |
| 2024-12-28 | start_work | Proposed | InProgress | Started implementation of undo/redo functionality | User |
| 2024-12-28 | complete | InProgress | Done | Implemented Zustand history store with 20-state limit and keyboard shortcuts | User |

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. **Undo/Redo Operations**: Support undo/redo for all graph editing actions
2. **History Limit**: Maintain maximum 20 history states to prevent memory issues
3. **Operation Coverage**: Cover node creation/deletion, edge connections, position changes, property updates
4. **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Implement Ctrl+Z (undo) and Ctrl+Y/Ctrl+Shift+Z (redo) shortcuts
5. **Visual Feedback**: Show undo/redo availability in UI
6. **Integration**: Work seamlessly with real-time sync from Task 2-34

### Technical Requirements
1. Use Zustand for history state management (not backend storage)
2. Track history locally for fast undo/redo operations
3. Sync final state to backend after undo/redo operations
4. Implement circular buffer for 20-state limit
5. Include operation types for better UX feedback

### History State Structure
```typescript
interface HistoryState {
  nodes: Node[];
  edges: Edge[];
  timestamp: number;
  operation: 'create_node' | 'delete_node' | 'move_node' | 'update_node' | 'create_edge' | 'delete_edge' | 'batch';
}
```

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: History Store
1. Create `useHistoryStore` Zustand store in `frontend/src/stores/`
2. Implement circular buffer for 20 history states
3. Add undo/redo actions with operation tracking
4. Include current state pointer management

### Phase 2: History Hook
1. Create `useGraphHistory` hook in `frontend/src/hooks/`
2. Provide undo/redo functions for React Flow
3. Handle state restoration and sync integration
4. Implement operation batching for multi-step actions

### Phase 3: FlowEditor Integration
1. Integrate history tracking with React Flow state changes
2. Capture node/edge operations automatically
3. Connect undo/redo to keyboard shortcuts
4. Add history controls to editor toolbar

### Phase 4: UI Controls
1. Add undo/redo buttons to editor toolbar
2. Show operation type in tooltips
3. Disable buttons when no history available
4. Add visual feedback for history operations

### Phase 5: Sync Integration
1. Coordinate with real-time sync from Task 2-34
2. Trigger backend sync after undo/redo operations
3. Handle conflict resolution between history and live changes
4. Prevent sync during rapid undo/redo sequences

## Test Plan

### Unit Tests
1. Test circular buffer implementation
2. Test undo/redo state transitions
3. Test operation tracking accuracy
4. Test history limit enforcement

### Integration Tests
1. Test undo/redo with real-time sync
2. Test keyboard shortcuts functionality
3. Test UI control states
4. Test batched operation handling

### Manual Testing
1. Perform various edit operations and test undo/redo
2. Test rapid undo/redo sequences
3. Test history limit (create 25+ operations)
4. Test keyboard shortcuts in different contexts
5. Verify sync coordination with backend

## Verification
- [ ] Undo/redo works for all node operations (create, delete, move, update)
- [ ] Undo/redo works for all edge operations (create, delete)
- [ ] History limited to maximum 20 states
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts work correctly (Ctrl+Z, Ctrl+Y)
- [ ] UI controls reflect history availability
- [ ] Backend sync triggers after undo/redo operations
- [ ] No performance issues with rapid undo/redo
- [ ] Operation types tracked correctly
